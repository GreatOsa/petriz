flowline,"The large-diameter metal pipe that connects the bell nipple under the rotary table to the possum belly at the mud tanks. The flowline is simply an inclined, gravity-flow conduit to direct mud coming out the top of the wellbore to the mud surface-treating equipment. When drilling certain highly reactive clays, called ""gumbo,"" the flowline may become plugged and require considerable effort by the rig crew to keep it open and flowing. In addition, the flowline is usually fitted with a crude paddle-type flow-measuring device commonly called a ""flow show"" that may give the driller the first indication that the well is flowing.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flowline

flow after flow,"A type of deliverability test conducted in gas wells to generate a stabilized gas deliverability curve (inflow performance relationship [IPR]). In a flow-after-flow test, a well flows under a constant rate until it reaches stabilized conditions (pseudosteady state). After the stabilized rate and pressure are recorded, the rate is changed and the well flows until pressure stabilizes again. The same procedure is repeated three or four times. The stabilization requirement is an important limitation of this type of test, especially in low-permeability formations, which require longer stabilization times. This test is also known as a backpressure or four-point test.",Noun,Production Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_after_flow

flow stream,"The flow of oil, gas, or water through a pipe.",Noun,Production Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_stream
fluid pound,"A phenomenon that occurs when the downhole pump rate exceeds the production rate of the formation. It can also be due to the accumulation of low-pressure gas between the valves. On the downstroke of the pump, the gas is compressed, but the pressure inside the barrel does not open the traveling valve until the traveling valve strikes the liquid. Finally when the traveling valve opens, the weight on the rod string can suddenly drop thousands of pounds in a fraction of a second. This condition should be avoided because it causes extreme stresses, which can result in premature equipment failure.

gas interference,"A phenomenon that occurs when gas enters the subsurface sucker-rod pump. After the downstroke begins, the compressed gas reaches the pressure needed to open the traveling valve before the traveling valve reaches liquid.

The flow rate from a well is limited to conserve reservoir energy, decrease friction forces, improve production efficiency, and prevent development of conditions that can reduce ultimate recovery. A high rate of fluid can generate a drastic cooling effect near the wellbore with the precipitation of scales and paraffins as well as a reduction of the oil relative permeability because of an increase in gas saturation.",Noun,Production Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/beam

leak detection,"The determination of the location of a leak in a pipeline. In onshore operations, this can be done by external detection or by using material balance leak-detection systems.

primary production,"Also known as primary recovery, the first stage of hydrocarbon production, in which natural reservoir energy, such as gasdrive, waterdrive or gravity drainage, displaces hydrocarbons from the reservoir, into the wellbore and up to surface.
