effective medium theory,"A method for determining the effective properties of random fields, commonly abbreviated EMT. Originally developed to estimate transport coefficients, this theory is based on the idea of replacing the inhomogeneous medium by an equivalent homogenous medium such that the fluctuations induced by restoring the heterogeneity average to zero.

log,"To continuously measure formation properties with electrically powered instruments to infer properties and make decisions about drilling and production operations. The record of the measurements, typically a long strip of paper, is also called a log. Measurements include electrical properties (resistivity and conductivity at various frequencies), sonic properties, active and passive nuclear measurements, dimensional measurements of the wellbore, formation fluid sampling, formation pressure measurement, wireline-conveyed sidewall coring tools, and others. For wireline measurements, the logging tool (or sonde) is lowered into the open wellbore on a multiple conductor, contra-helically armored wireline cable. Once the tool string (link to ID 2964) has reached the bottom of the interval of interest, measurements are taken on the way out of the wellbore. This is done in an attempt to maintain tension on the cable (which stretches) as constant as possible for depth correlation purposes. (The exception to this practice is in certain hostile environments in which the tool electronics might not survive the downhole temperatures for long enough to allow the tool to be lowered to the bottom of the hole and measurements to be recorded while pulling the tool up the hole. In this case, ""down log"" measurements might be conducted on the way into the well, and repeated on the way out if possible.) Most wireline measurements are recorded continuously while the sonde is moving. Certain fluid sampling and pressure-measuring tools require that the sonde be stopped, increasing the chance that the sonde or the cable might become stuck. Logging while drilling (LWD) tools take measurements in much the same way as wireline-logging tools, except that the measurements are taken by a self-contained tool near the bottom of the bottomhole assembly and are recorded downward (as the well is deepened) rather than upward from the bottom of the hole.",Verb,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/log

multiple regression,"Regression techniques that find relationships between two or more variables that have a complex (nonlinear) relationship. Porosity and permeability relationships are often of this form in rocks that have multiple porosity types (primary, intergranular, fracture or vugular porosity, for example) or multiple cement types and other variables that affect permeability.",Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiple_regression
multishot survey,A technique for determining the deviation of a wellbore. The multishot tool provides more accuracy than the single-shot tool and is usually used in highly deviated wells.,Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multishot_survey
model,"A representation of a physical property or entity that can be used to make predictions or compare observations with assumptions. Mathematical velocity models are commonly used to predict the depth to a formation of interest. Physical models, such as layers of clay or putty, can be used to simulate rock layers. As Sheriff (1991) points out, agreement between data and a model does not prove that the model is correct, since there can be numerous models that agree with a given dataset.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/model
Monte Carlo risk analysis,"An approach to performing risk analysis on any project with uncertain input data. Generally, numbers are selected from representative input data and then used in iterative, CPU-intensive calculations to find the most likely outcome and the range of probable outcomes. The uncertainty in the output also provides a measure of the validity of the model. The technique is applied to financial investment portfolio and investment risk analysis as well as scientific applications. Monte Carlo analysis methods are used in the oil field to estimate the risks involved in new exploration projects, evaluation of development schemes and evaluation of validity of reservoir models.",Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/monte_carlo_risk_analysis
modeling,The act of constructing a model.,Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/modeling
Monte Carlo simulation,The use of Monte Carlo risk analysis techniques to estimate the most probable outcomes from a model with uncertain input data and to estimate the validity of the simulated model.,Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/monte_carlo_simulation
Monte Carlo sampling,The sampling of uncertain data for use in Monte Carlo risk analysis or simulation.,Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/monte_carlo_sampling
moment,The product of a physical quantity and its distance from an axis or a tendency to cause motion around an axis.,Noun,General Terms,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/moment
empirical,Pertaining to analysis that includes equations or formulae that were derived purely from data analysis and were not derived from a theoretical basis. The majority of equations used in reservoir characterization and reservoir engineering are empirical.,Adjective,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/empirical
eigenvector,"The vector that best represents the trend of data in multiple dimensions. This is the major component of principal component analysis (PCA). In log analysis, log data plotted in the number of dimensions equal to the number of curves can be subjected to principal component analysis, replotted in PCA space, and then subjected to cluster analysis to find usable electrofacies.",Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/eigenvector
expectation,"The results of extrapolating from a known data point to points away from measurements. In geostatistical modeling, generating expectation trends is a fundamental process that requires procedures to estimate geometric changes by using various statistical approaches. Often, trends in surfaces are estimated and used to provide bounds on possible facies extrapolation.",Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/expectation
Euclidian distance,The distance between two points in Euclidian space. Euclidian dimensions are all orthogonal to each other (they are all at right angles to each other) and refer to physical space.,Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/euclidian_distance
Epanechnikov kernel,"A discontinuous parabola kernel that is used in contouring areal density of data points in a crossplot. The kernel function can take many other forms, such as triangular, rectangular or Gaussian. The function determines the shape of the bump or cluster of data under scrutiny. This technology is often used in cluster analysis and statistical graphic techniques.",Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/epanechnikov_kernel
eustatic sea level,"Global sea level, which changes in response to changes in the volume of ocean water and the volume of ocean basins.",Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/eustatic_sea_level
Euclidian dimension,"A dimension in Euclidian space. Euclidian dimensions are all orthogonal to each other (at right angles to each other) and refer to physical space with X, Y and Z components.",Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/euclidian_dimension
expert system,"A computer system that uses a rule-based algorithm to provide expertise on a given subject. Many computer programs have been written for use in the oil field using rule-based approaches to provide expert systems. The rules are taken from an expert working in the field and are written in a way that attempts to reproduce the knowledge and approaches used by that expert to solve a range of actual problems. Most such programs are limited to specific disciplines such as dipmeter interpretation, electrofacies determination, reservoir characterization, blowout prevention or drilling fluid selection. Sometimes expert systems are written in computer languages such as LISP that easily handles rules, but once fully tested, expert systems are usually translated to BASIC, C or FORTRAN to be compiled into efficient applications or programs.",Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/expert_system
error,A data value that is not correct. This could be caused by a faulty measurement or by incorrect processing of the data.,Noun,Reservoir Characterization,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/error
