packer,"A device that can be run into a wellbore with a smaller initial outside diameter that then expands externally to seal the wellbore. Packers employ flexible, elastomeric elements that expand. The two most common forms are the production or test packer and the inflatable packer. The expansion of the former may be accomplished by squeezing the elastomeric elements (somewhat doughnut shaped) between two plates, forcing the sides to bulge outward. The expansion of the latter is accomplished by pumping a fluid into a bladder, in much the same fashion as a balloon, but having more robust construction. Production or test packers may be set in cased holes and inflatable packers are used in open or cased holes. They may be run on wireline, pipe or coiled tubing. Some packers are designed to be removable, while others are permanent. Permanent packers are constructed of materials that are easy to drill or mill out.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/packer
Christmas tree,"The set of valves, spools, and fittings connected to the top of a well to direct and control the flow of formation fluids from the well.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/christmas_tree
expansion joint,A device or completion component designed to enable relative movement between two fixed assemblies in the event of thermal expansion or contraction. The forces generated by thermal expansion or contraction can be significant. Expansion joints within the completion assembly prevent any movement or forces being transmitted to fixed components such as packers or tubing hangers.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/expansion_joint
expendable plug,"A temporary plug, inserted in the completion assembly before it is run, to enable pressure testing of the completed string. With the operation complete, the expendable plug can be pumped out of the assembly, thereby avoiding a separate retrieval run.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/expendable_plug
equalizing valve,"A device that is operated to equalize the pressure across a valve, plug or similar pressure or fluid isolation barrier. The operating mechanism on many pressure-sealing devices is rendered inoperable once the mechanism has been activated by pressure. In such cases, the pressure across the pressure barrier must be equalized before the barrier can be removed.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/equalizing_valve
external pulling tool,A downhole tool used to pull or retrieve temporary plugs or similar equipment. The external pulling tool engages on the external surfaces of the item to be retrieved.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/external_pulling_tool
electric submersible pump,"An artificial-lift system that utilizes a downhole pumping system that is electrically driven. The pump typically comprises several staged centrifugal pump sections that can be specifically configured to suit the production and wellbore characteristics of a given application. Electrical submersible pump systems are a common artificial-lift method, providing flexibility over a range of sizes and output flow capacities.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electric_submersible_pump
external upset,A type of tubing connection in which the external diameter of the tubing joint is larger adjacent to the tubing connection to provide the necessary strength. The internal tubing surface is flush to enable good fluid-flow characteristics.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/external_upset
flag joint,A joint of tubing or casing included in the string at a known position to provide a reference point for further operations. A short pup joint that registers clearly in a collar locator log is a common flag joint.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flag_joint
fines migration,"The movement of fine clay, quartz particles or similar materials within the reservoir formation due to drag forces during production. Fines migration may result from an unconsolidated or inherently unstable formation, or from use of an incompatible treatment fluid that liberates fine particles. Unlike sand migration that is best stabilized, the material mobilized in fines migration should be produced to avoid near-wellbore damage. Fines migration causes particles suspended in the produced fluid to bridge the pore throats near the wellbore, reducing well productivity. Fines can include different materials such as clays (phyllosilicates smaller than 4 microns) and silts (silicates or aluminosilicates with sizes ranging from 4 to 64 microns). Kaolinite and illite are the most common migrating clays. Damage created by fines usually is located within a radius of 3 to 5 ft [1 to 2 m] of the wellbore, but can also occur in gravel-pack completions. In sandstone formations, hydrofluoric acid [HF] mixtures are used to dissolve fines. In carbonate formations, the goal is not to dissolve but rather to disperse fines in the wormholes, so hydrochloric [HCl] acid is used as the treatment fluid.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fines_migration
fixed choke,A device used to control the flow of fluids by directing flow through a restriction or hole of a fixed size. The fluid characteristics and the pressure differential across the choke determine the flow rate through a fixed choke.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fixed_choke
float shoe,"A rounded profile component attached to the downhole end of a casing string. An integral check valve in the float shoe prevents reverse flow, or U-tubing, of cement slurry from the annulus into the casing or flow of wellbore fluids into the casing string as it is run. The float shoe also guides the casing toward the center of the hole to minimize hitting rock ledges or washouts as the casing is run into the wellbore. The float shoe reduces hook weight. With controlled or partial fill-up as the string is run, the casing string can be floated into position, avoiding the need for the rig to carry the entire weight of the casing string. The outer portions of the float shoe are made of steel and generally match the casing size and threads, although not necessarily the casing grade. The inside (including the taper) is usually made of cement or thermoplastic, since this material must be drilled out if the well is to be deepened beyond the casing point.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/float_shoe
flange,A connection profile used in pipe work and associated equipment to provide a means of assembling and disassembling components. Most oilfield flanges feature a bolt-hole pattern to allow the joint to be secured and a gasket profile to ensure a pressure-tight seal. The design and specification of a flange relates to the size and pressure capacity of the equipment to which it is fitted.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flange
flange up,The process of assembling flanged components such as pressure-control equipment.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flange_up
float collar,"A component installed near the bottom of the casing string on which cement plugs land during the primary cementing operation. It typically consists of a short length of casing fitted with a check valve. This device may be a flapper-valve type, a spring-loaded ball valve or other type. The check-valve assembly fixed within the float collar prevents flowback of the cement slurry when pumping is stopped. Without a float collar, the cement slurry placed in the annulus could U-tube, or reverse flow back into the casing. The greater density of cement slurries than the displacement mud inside the casing causes the U-tube effect.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/float_collar
frac fluid,"An abbreviation for fracturing fluid, a fluid injected into a well as part of a stimulation operation. Fracturing fluids for shale reservoirs usually contain water, proppant, and a small amount of nonaqueous fluids designed to reduce friction pressure while pumping the fluid into the wellbore. These fluids typically include gels, friction reducers, crosslinkers, breakers and surfactants similar to household cosmetics and cleaning products; these additives are selected for their capability to improve the results of the stimulation operation and the productivity of the well.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_fluid
fracturing mandrel,A sleeve with a flanged top connection upon which a frac tree is installed.

frac head,A flow cross installed on top of a frac tree where treating iron is connected and treatment fluid enters the frac tree.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_head
froth flow,"A multiphase flow regime in near-vertical pipes in which large, irregular slugs of gas move up the center of the pipe, usually carrying droplets of oil or water with them. Most of the remaining oil or water flows up along the pipe walls. The flow is relatively chaotic, producing a frothy mixture. Unlike slug flow, neither phase is continuous. The gas slugs are relatively unstable, and take on large, elongated shapes. Also known as transition flow, this flow is an intermediate flow condition between slug flow and mist flow, and occurs at relatively high gas velocity. As the gas velocity increases, it changes into annular flow.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/froth_flow
free water,"Water that is mobile, available to flow, and not bound to surfaces of grains or minerals in rock.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/free_water
frac manifold,"A system of frac valves that directs treatment fluid from the missile to multiple frac trees. The frac manifold facilitates quick redirection of fracturing pressure from one well to another, enabling pump trucks to run nearly continuously to minimize downtime.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_manifold
fracture,"A crack or surface of breakage within rock not related to foliation or cleavage in metamorphic rock along which there has been no movement. A fracture along which there has been displacement is a fault. When walls of a fracture have moved only normal to each other, the fracture is called a joint. Fractures can enhance permeability of rocks greatly by connecting pores together, and for that reason, fractures are induced mechanically in some reservoirs in order to boost hydrocarbon flow. Fractures may also be referred to as natural fractures to distinguish them from fractures induced as part of a reservoir stimulation or drilling operation. In some shale reservoirs, natural fractures improve production by enhancing effective permeability. In other cases, natural fractures can complicate reservoir stimulation.",Noun,"Shale Gas, Geology",https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracture
frac stack,"A Christmas tree installed specifically for the fracturing process. A frac stack typically consists of upper and lower master valves, flow cross, wing valves, goat head, and swab valve.

fracturing sleeve,"Similar to a fracturing mandrel, a fracturing sleeve is temporarily inserted into a wellhead before the fracturing process begins to isolate low-pressure connections from the higher fracturing pressures. Fracturing sleeves differ from fracturing mandrels in that the fracturing sleeve is fully contained within the wellhead, and the frac tree is installed on the wellhead, not the sleeve.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracturing_sleeve
fracturing manifold,"A system of frac valves that directs treatment fluid from the missile to multiple frac trees. The frac manifold facilitates quick redirection of fracturing pressure from one well to another, enabling pump trucks to run nearly continuously to minimize downtime.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracturing_manifold
frac tree,"A Christmas tree installed specifically for the fracturing process. A frac tree typically consists of upper and lower master valves, flow cross, wing valves, goat head, and swab valve. Frac trees generally have larger bores and higher pressure ratings than production trees to accommodate the high flow rates and pressures necessary for hydraulic fracturing.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_tree
frac job,"Another term for hydraulic fracturing, a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing a vertical fracture to open. The wings of the fracture extend away from the wellbore in opposing directions according to the natural stresses within the formation. Proppant, such as grains of sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the fracture open when the treatment is complete. Hydraulic fracturing creates high-conductivity communication with a large area of formation and bypasses any damage that may exist in the near-wellbore area.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_job
frac balls,"Another term for ball sealers, small spheres designed to seal perforations that are accepting the most fluid, thereby diverting reservoir treatments to other portions of the target zone. Ball sealers are incorporated into the treatment fluid and pumped with it. The effectiveness of this type of mechanical diversion to keep the balls in place is strongly dependent on the differential pressure across the perforation and the geometry of the perforation itself.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_balls
fracturing fluid,"A fluid injected into a well as part of a stimulation operation. Fracturing fluids for shale reservoirs usually contain water, proppant, and a small amount of nonaqueous fluids designed to reduce friction pressure while pumping the fluid into the wellbore. These fluids typically include gels, friction reducers, crosslinkers, breakers and surfactants similar to household cosmetics and cleaning products; these additives are selected for their capability to improve the results of the stimulation operation and the productivity of the well.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracturing_fluid
fluid-loss additive,A group of mud additives specifically designed to lower the volume of filtrate that passes through a filter medium. Specific materials are available for all types of water- and oil-base mud systems and are evaluated in static filtration tests or in various dynamic filtration tests.,Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fluid-loss_additive
formation pressure,"The pressure of fluids within the pores of a reservoir, usually hydrostatic pressure, or the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level. When impermeable rocks such as shales form as sediments are compacted, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to anomalously high formation pressures. Because reservoir pressure changes as fluids are produced from a reservoir, the pressure should be described as measured at a specific time, such as initial reservoir pressure.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_pressure
formation damage,"Alteration of the far-field or virgin characteristics of a producing formation, usually by exposure to drilling fluids. The water or solid particles in the drilling fluids, or both, tend to decrease the pore volume and effective permeability of the producible formation in the near-wellbore region. At least two mechanisms are at work. First, solid particles from the drilling fluid physically plug or bridge across flowpaths in the porous formation. Second, when water contacts certain clay minerals in the formation, the clay typically swells, increasing in volume and decreasing the pore volume. Third, chemical reactions between the drilling fluid and the formation rock and fluids can precipitate solids or semisolids that plug pore spaces. One approach to minimize formation damage is to use drill-in or completion fluids that are specially formulated to avoid damage to the formation when drilling pay zones, rather than ordinary drilling fluids.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_damage
formation fluid,"Any fluid that occurs in the pores of a rock. Strata containing different fluids, such as various saturations of oil, gas and water, may be encountered in the process of drilling an oil or gas well. Fluids found in the target reservoir formation are referred to as reservoir fluids.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_fluid

flow coupling,"A relatively short, heavy-walled completion component installed in areas where turbulence is anticipated. The additional wall thickness prevents early failures due to erosion in the turbulent flow area. Flow couplings are typically installed above and below completion components, such as landing nipples, that may affect the flow.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_coupling
formation fracture pressure,Pressure above which injection of fluids will cause the rock formation to fracture hydraulically.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_fracture_pressure
flush joint,"A type of tubing connection in which the internal or external surfaces are the same diameter throughout the tubing joint. Internal flush joints are most common, offering no restriction to fluid flow.

gas separator,"A device used to separate entrained gas from production liquids. Surface processing facilities generally use gas separators to render the liquids safe for further processing or disposal. Gas-separation equipment is also used in downhole applications, such as the protection of pumping equipment against gas lock by separating and redirecting free gas at the pump suction or inlet.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gas_separator
gas-lift mandrel,"A gas-lift system component that is assembled with the production tubing string to provide a means of locating gas-lift valves. The position or depth of the gas lift valves is crucial to the efficient operation of the entire system. Consequently, proper assembly of the gas lift mandrels within the completion tubulars is essential.

gas lift,"An artificial-lift method in which gas is injected into the production tubing to reduce the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column. The resulting reduction in bottomhole pressure allows the reservoir liquids to enter the wellbore at a higher flow rate. The injection gas is typically conveyed down the tubing-casing annulus and enters the production train through a series of gas-lift valves. The gas-lift valve position, operating pressures and gas injection rate are determined by specific well conditions.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gas_lift
gas coning,Change in the gas-oil contact profile as a result of drawdown pressures during production.

hookwall packer,"A type of packer than utilizes an assembly of friction blocks and slips to set and anchor the packer on the casing or liner wall. Hookwall packers generally are run on tubing or drillpipe and typically require some rotation of the packer assembly to activate or set the packer slips. Subsequent application of tension or compression, depending on packer design, will set the packer elements.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hookwall_packer
high-pressure manifold,"Flow control unit used in the pressurization of fluid employed in hydraulic fracturing.

Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing a vertical fracture to open. The wings of the fracture extend away from the wellbore in opposing directions according to the natural stresses within the formation. Proppant, such as grains of sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the fracture open when the treatment is complete. Hydraulic fracturing creates high-conductivity communication with a large area of formation and bypasses any damage that may exist in the near-wellbore area.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydraulic_fracturing
hydrogen sulfide,"[H2S] An extraordinarily poisonous gas with a molecular formula of H2S. At low concentrations, H2S has the odor of rotten eggs, but at higher, lethal concentrations, it is odorless. H2S is hazardous to workers and a few seconds of exposure at relatively low concentrations can be lethal, but exposure to lower concentrations can also be harmful. The effect of H2S depends on duration, frequency and intensity of exposure as well as the susceptibility of the individual. Hydrogen sulfide is a serious and potentially lethal hazard, so awareness, detection and monitoring of H2S is essential. Since hydrogen sulfide gas is present in some subsurface formations, drilling and other operational crews must be prepared to use detection equipment, personal protective equipment, proper training and contingency procedures in H2S-prone areas. Hydrogen sulfide is produced during the decomposition of organic matter and occurs with hydrocarbons in some areas. It enters drilling mud from subsurface formations and can also be generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria in stored muds. H2S can cause sulfide-stress-corrosion cracking of metals. Because it is corrosive, H2S production may require costly special production equipment such as stainless steel tubing. Sulfides can be precipitated harmlessly from water muds or oil muds by treatments with the proper sulfide scavenger. H2S is a weak acid, donating two hydrogen ions in neutralization reactions, forming HS- and S-2 ions. In water or water-base muds, the three sulfide species, H2S and HS- and S-2 ions, are in dynamic equilibrium with water and H+ and OH- ions. The percent distribution among the three sulfide species depends on pH. H2S is dominant at low pH, the HS- ion is dominant at mid-range pH and S2 ions dominate at high pH. In this equilibrium situation, sulfide ions revert to H2S if pH falls. Sulfides in water mud and oil mud can be quantitatively measured with the Garrett Gas Train according to procedures set by API.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrogen_sulfide

HF,"A poisonous liquid acid composed of hydrogen and fluorine. Hydrofluoric acid [HF] is used primarily because it is the only common, inexpensive mineral acid that can dissolve siliceous minerals. HF is typically mixed with hydrochloric acid [HCl] or organic acid to keep the pH low when it spends, thereby preventing detrimental precipitates. These mixtures, also called mud acids, are considered the main fluid in a sandstone acid treatment because they remove formation damage. Hydrofluoric acid should not be used in sandstone formations with high carbonate content because of the high risk of calcium fluoride precipitation [CaF2].",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hf
hammer union,A connection common in the oil industry consisting of two joints coupled by a threaded nut. Protrusions on the nut are hit with a sledgehammer to tighten the connection and energize the seals. Hammer unions are commonly used on treating iron because of their ability to be quickly made up or broken down.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hammer_union
hydrofluoric-hydrochloric acid,"A mixture of hydrofluoric acid [HF] and hydrochloric acid [HCl] or organic acid used as the main fluid in a sandstone matrix treatment. Hydrochloric acid or organic acid is mixed with HF to keep the pH low when it spends, thereby preventing detrimental precipitates. The name mud acid was given to these mixtures because they were originally developed to treat damage from siliceous drilling muds.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrofluoric-hydrochloric_acid
hydraulic fracture monitoring,"A technique to track the propagation of a hydraulic fracture as it advances through a formation. Microseisms are detected, located, and displayed in time for scientists and engineers to approximate the location and propagation of the hydraulic fracture. Software provides modeling, survey design, microseismic detection and location, uncertainty analysis, data integration, and visualization for interpretation. Computer imagery is used to monitor the activity in 3D space relative to the location of the fracturing treatment. The monitored activities are animated to show progressive fracture growth and the subsurface response to pumping variations. When displayed in real time, the microseismic activity allows one to make changes to the stimulation design to ensure optimal reservoir contact. Also known as microseismic monitoring, this technique delivers information about the effectiveness of the stimulation of a reservoir that can be used to enhance reservoir development in shale gas completions.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydraulic_fracture_monitoring
hydraulic set,"A setting or operating method that uses hydraulic force applied through the tubing or running string to activate a downhole tool.

diverter,"A chemical agent or mechanical device used in injection treatments, such as matrix stimulation, to ensure a uniform distribution of treatment fluid across the treatment interval. Injected fluids tend to follow the path of least resistance, possibly resulting in the least permeable areas receiving inadequate treatment. By using some means of diversion, the treatment can be focused on the areas requiring the most treatment. To be effective, the diversion effect should be temporary to enable the full productivity of the well to be restored when the treatment is complete. There are two main categories of diversion: chemical diversion and mechanical diversion. Chemical diverters function by creating a temporary blocking effect that is safely cleaned up following the treatment, enabling enhanced productivity throughout the treated interval. Mechanical diverters act as physical barriers to ensure even treatment.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diverter

jar,"A mechanical device used downhole to deliver an impact load to another downhole component, especially when that component is stuck. There are two primary types, hydraulic and mechanical jars. While their respective designs are quite different, their operation is similar. Energy is stored in the drillstring and suddenly released by the jar when it fires. The principle is similar to that of a carpenter using a hammer. Kinetic energy is stored in the hammer as it is swung, and suddenly released to the nail and board when the hammer strikes the nail. Jars can be designed to strike up, down, or both. In the case of jarring up above a stuck bottomhole assembly, the driller slowly pulls up on the drillstring but the BHA does not move. Since the top of the drillstring is moving up, this means that the drillstring itself is stretching and storing energy. When the jars reach their firing point, they suddenly allow one section of the jar to move axially relative to a second, being pulled up rapidly in much the same way that one end of a stretched spring moves when released. After a few inches of movement, this moving section slams into a steel shoulder, imparting an impact load. In addition to the mechanical and hydraulic versions, jars are classified as drilling jars or fishing jars. The operation of the two types is similar, and both deliver approximately the same impact blow, but the drilling jar is built such that it can better withstand the rotary and vibrational loading associated with drilling.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/j/jar
J slot,"A type of mechanism commonly used in the setting and unsetting of downhole tools and equipment such as packers.

plug and abandon,"To prepare a well to be closed permanently, usually after either logs determine there is insufficient hydrocarbon potential to complete the well, or after production operations have drained the reservoir. Different regulatory bodies have their own requirements for plugging operations. Most require that cement plugs be placed and tested across any open hydrocarbon-bearing formations, across all casing shoes, across freshwater aquifers, and perhaps several other areas near the surface, including the top 20 to 50 ft [6 to 15 m] of the wellbore. The well designer may choose to set bridge plugs in conjunction with cement slurries to ensure that higher density cement does not fall in the wellbore. In that case, the bridge plug would be set and cement pumped on top of the plug through drillpipe, and then the drillpipe withdrawn before the slurry thickened.",Verb,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/plug_and_abandon
plunger lift,"An artificial-lift method principally used in gas wells to unload relatively small volumes of liquid. An automated system mounted on the wellhead controls the well on an intermittent flow regime. When the well is shut-in, a plunger is dropped down the production string. When the control system opens the well for production, the plunger and a column of fluid are carried up the tubing string. The surface receiving mechanism detects the plunger when it arrives at surface and, through the control system, prepares for the next cycle.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/plunger_lift
pipe stretch,The increase in length resulting from the combination of forces acting on a string within the wellbore.

pack off,"To plug the wellbore around a drillstring. This can happen for a variety of reasons, the most common being that either the drilling fluid is not properly transporting cuttings and cavings out of the annulus or portions of the wellbore wall collapse around the drillstring. When the well packs off, there is a sudden reduction or loss of the ability to circulate, and high pump pressures follow. If prompt remedial action is not successful, an expensive episode of stuck pipe can result. The term is also used in gravel packing to describe the act of placing all the sand or gravel in the annulus.",Verb,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pack_off

produced fluid,A generic term used in a number of contexts but most commonly to describe any fluid produced from a wellbore that is not a treatment fluid. The characteristics and phase composition of a produced fluid vary and use of the term often implies an inexact or unknown composition.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/produced_fluid
pore pressure,"The pressure of fluids within the pores of a reservoir, usually hydrostatic pressure, or the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level. When impermeable rocks such as shales form as sediments are compacted, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to anomalously high formation pressures. Because reservoir pressure changes as fluids are produced from a reservoir, the pressure should be described as measured at a specific time, such as initial reservoir pressure.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pore_pressure
positive displacement pump,"A type of fluid pump in which the displacement volume of the pump is fixed for each rotation of the pump.

velocity string,"A small-diameter tubing string run inside the production tubing of a well as a remedial treatment to resolve liquid-loading problems. As the reservoir pressure in a gas well depletes, there may be insufficient velocity to transport all liquids from the wellbore. In time these liquids accumulate and impair production. Installing a velocity string reduces the flow area and increases the flow velocity to enable liquids to be carried from the wellbore. Velocity strings are commonly run using coiled tubing as a velocity string conduit. Safe live-well working and rapid mobilization enable coiled tubing velocity strings to provide a cost effective solution to liquid loading in gas wells.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/velocity_string
vertical lift,The vertical distance between two points in a horizontal or deviated wellbore.

water block,"A condition caused by an increase in water saturation in the near-wellbore area. Water block typically forms during the drilling phase of a well, when the near-wellbore area is exposed to a relatively high volume of filtrate from the drilling fluid. The increased presence of water causes fine clay crystals that may be present in the formation, such as illite, to swell and cause a reduction in permeability. Water-block treatments typically use surfactants to reduce the surface tension between the oil and water, helping to displace the water from the near-wellbore area.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/water_block
waterflooding,"A method of secondary recovery in which water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil.

swab,"To reduce pressure in a wellbore by moving pipe, wireline tools or rubber-cupped seals up the wellbore. If the pressure is reduced sufficiently, reservoir fluids may flow into the wellbore and towards the surface. Swabbing is generally considered harmful in drilling operations, because it can lead to kicks and wellbore stability problems. In production operations, however, the term is used to describe how the flow of reservoir hydrocarbons is initiated in some completed wells.",Verb,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/swab
swivel flange,"A flange consisting of two parts�a hub and a ring. The hub contains the gasket profile, and the ring features the bolt-hole pattern.

sulfide stress cracking,"A type of spontaneous brittle failure in steels and other high-strength alloys when they are in contact with moist hydrogen sulfide and other sulfidic environments. Tool joints, hardened parts of blowout preventers and valve trim are particularly susceptible. For this reason, along with toxicity risks of hydrogen sulfide gas, it is essential that water muds be kept entirely free of soluble sulfides and especially hydrogen sulfide at low pH. Sulfide stress cracking is also called hydrogen sulfide cracking, sulfide cracking, sulfide corrosion cracking and sulfide stress-corrosion cracking. The variation of the name is due to the lack of agreement in the mechanism of failure. Some researchers consider sulfide-stress cracking a type of stress-corrosion cracking, while others consider it a type of hydrogen embrittlement.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sulfide_stress_cracking

Sliding sleeves incorporate a system of ports that can be opened or closed by a sliding component that is generally controlled and operated by slickline tool string.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sliding_sleeve
shoe track,"Another term for float joint, a full-sized length of casing placed at the bottom of the casing string that is usually left full of cement on the inside to ensure that good cement remains on the outside of the bottom of the casing. If cement were not left inside the casing in this manner, the risk of overdisplacing the cement (due to improper casing volume calculations, displacement mud volume measurements, or both) would be significantly higher. Hence, the well designer plans on a safety margin of cement left inside the casing to guarantee that the fluid left outside the casing is good-quality cement. A float collar is placed at the top of the float joint and a float shoe placed at the bottom to prevent reverse flow of cement back into the casing after placement. There can be one, two or three joints of casing used for this purpose.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shoe_track
shifting tool,"A downhole tool, most commonly associated with slickline operations, that is used to open, close or shift the position of downhole flow control or circulation devices, such as sliding sleeves.

Typical scales are calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, strontium sulfate, iron sulfide, iron oxides, iron carbonate, the various silicates and phosphates and oxides, or any of a number of compounds insoluble or slightly soluble in water.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/scale
sand control,"The installation of equipment or application of techniques to prevent migration of reservoir sand into the wellbore or near-wellbore area. In weak formations, sand control may be necessary to maintain the structure of the reservoir around the wellbore. In other formation types, the migration of sand and fines into the near wellbore area may severely restrict production. Each of these conditions requires different treatments. The principal sand-control techniques include gravel packing and sand consolidation.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sand_control
scale inhibitor,"A chemical treatment used to control or prevent scale deposition in the production conduit or completion system. Scale-inhibitor chemicals may be continuously injected through a downhole injection point in the completion, or periodic squeeze treatments may be undertaken to place the inhibitor in the reservoir matrix for subsequent commingling with produced fluids. Some scale-inhibitor systems integrate scale inhibitors and fracture treatments into one step, which guarantees that the entire well is treated with scale inhibitor. In this type of treatment, a high-efficiency scale inhibitor is pumped into the matrix surrounding the fracture face during leakoff. It adsorbs to the matrix during pumping until the fracture begins to produce water. As water passes through the inhibitor-adsorbed zone, it dissolves sufficient inhibitor to prevent scale deposition. The inhibitor is better placed than in a conventional scale-inhibitor squeeze, which reduces the retreatment cost and improves production.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/scale_inhibitor
screen,"A device used in sand control applications to support the gravel pack. To form a screen, a profiled wire is wrapped and welded in place on a perforated liner.

This creates a sudden and significant restriction to fluid flow that causes a rapid rise in pump pressure.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/screenout
sand consolidation,A means of controlling the undesirable production of sand from weak sandstone formations. Sand consolidation chemically binds the grains of sand that make up the formation matrix while maintaining sufficient permeability to achieve viable production rates.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sand_consolidation

sequestering agent,"A chemical whose molecular structure can envelop and hold a certain type of ion in a stable and soluble complex. Divalent cations, such as hardness ions, form stable and soluble complex structures with several types of sequestering chemicals. When held inside the complex, the ions have a limited ability to react with other ions, clays or polymers. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a well-known sequestering agent for the hardness ions, such as Ca+2, and is the reagent solution used in the hardness test protocol published by API. Polyphosphates can also sequester hardness ions. The addition of sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) to a cement-contaminated mud renders the calcium ions essentially nonreactive with clays in the mud. As a side benefit, SAPP also lowers mud pH. Sequestering is not the same as precipitation because sequestering does not form a solid.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sequestering_agent
safety joint,"A weak spot in the drillstring. Such a weak spot sometimes is intentionally put into the drillstring so that if tension in the drillstring exceeds a predetermined amount, the safety joint will part and the rest of the drillstring will be salvageable. A safety joint is commonly included in fishing strings and drillstem testing equipment, where the fish may be successfully caught by the fishing assembly, but tension to free the fish may prove insurmountable. By having the safety joint in the hole, the fishing company representative knows where the fishing string will part and what will be needed to latch onto the top of this additional fish.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/safety_joint
sand bailer,"A downhole device, usually run on slickline, used to remove sand or debris from the bottom of the wellbore.

solution gas,"Dissolved gas in wellbore or reservoir fluids. The gas will remain in solution until the pressure or temperature conditions change, at which time it may break out of solution to become free gas.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/solution_gas
steamflood,"A method of thermal recovery in which steam generated at surface is injected into the reservoir through specially distributed injection wells. When steam enters the reservoir, it heats up the crude oil and reduces its viscosity. The heat also distills light components of the crude oil, which condense in the oil bank ahead of the steam front, further reducing the oil viscosity. The hot water that condenses from the steam and the steam itself generate an artificial drive that sweeps oil toward producing wells. Another contributing factor that enhances oil production during steam injection is related to near-wellbore cleanup. In this case, steam reduces the interfacial tension that ties paraffins and asphaltenes to the rock surfaces while steam distillation of crude oil light ends creates a small solvent bank that can miscibly remove trapped oil. Steamflooding is also called continuous steam injection or steam drive.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/steamflood
standing valve,"A downhole valve assembly that is designed to hold pressure from above while allowing fluids to flow from below.

The control system operates in a fail-safe mode, with hydraulic control pressure used to hold open a ball or flapper assembly that will close if the control pressure is lost.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/surface-controlled_subsurface_safety_valve_scssv
production tubing,"A wellbore tubular used to produce reservoir fluids. Production tubing is assembled with other completion components to make up the production string. The production tubing selected for any completion should be compatible with the wellbore geometry, reservoir production characteristics and the reservoir fluids.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/production_tubing
control line,"A small-diameter hydraulic line used to operate downhole completion equipment such as the surface controlled subsurface safety valve (SCSSV). Most systems operated by control line operate on a fail-safe basis. In this mode, the control line remains pressurized at all times. Any leak or failure results in loss of control line pressure, acting to close the safety valve and render the well safe.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/control_line
completion,"The hardware used to optimize the production of hydrocarbons from the well. This may range from nothing but a packer on tubing above an openhole completion (""barefoot"" completion), to a system of mechanical filtering elements outside of perforated pipe, to a fully automated measurement and control system that optimizes reservoir economics without human intervention (an ""intelligent"" completion).",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/completion
fullbore,"A description of the internal area and surfaces of a tool or tubular assembly through which there is an unimpeded internal diameter.

reservoir pressure,"The pressure of fluids within the pores of a reservoir, usually hydrostatic pressure, or the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level. When impermeable rocks such as shales form as sediments are compacted, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to anomalously high formation pressures. Because reservoir pressure changes as fluids are produced from a reservoir, the pressure should be described as measured at a specific time, such as initial reservoir pressure.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reservoir_pressure
injection well,"A well in which fluids are injected rather than produced, the primary objective typically being to maintain reservoir pressure. Two main types of injection are common: gas and water. Separated gas from production wells or possibly imported gas may be reinjected into the upper gas section of the reservoir. Water-injection wells are common offshore, where filtered and treated seawater is injected into a lower water-bearing section of the reservoir.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/injection_well
gas injection,"A reservoir maintenance or secondary recovery method that uses injected gas to supplement the pressure in an oil reservoir or field. In most cases, a field will incorporate a planned distribution of gas-injection wells to maintain reservoir pressure and effect an efficient sweep of recoverable liquids.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gas_injection
transition flow,"A multiphase flow regime in near-vertical pipes in which large, irregular slugs of gas move up the center of the pipe, usually carrying droplets of oil or water with them. Most of the remaining oil or water flows up along the pipe walls. The flow is relatively chaotic, producing a frothy mixture. Unlike slug flow, neither phase is continuous. The gas slugs are relatively unstable, and take on large, elongated shapes. Also known as churn flow, this flow is an intermediate flow condition between slug flow and mist flow, and occurs at relatively high gas velocity. As the gas velocity increases, it changes into annular flow.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transition_flow
tail pipe,"The tubulars and completion components run below a production packer. The tail pipe may be included in a completion design for several reasons. It can provide a facility for plugs and other temporary flow-control devices, improve downhole hydraulic characteristics, and provide a suspension point for downhole gauges and monitoring equipment.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tail_pipe
tapered string,"A string of drillpipe or casing that consists of two or more sizes or weights. In most tapered strings, a larger diameter pipe or casing is placed at the top of the wellbore and the smaller size at the bottom. Note that since the pipe is put into the well bottom first, the smaller pipe is run into the hole first, followed by the larger diameter. Other than the different sizes, which are usually chosen to optimize well economics, there is nothing distinctive about the pipe sections. However, pipe-handling tools must be available for each pipe size, not just one size, as is the typical case.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tapered_string
tag,"To contact, or tag, a known reference point or obstruction in the wellbore with the tubing string, wireline or other intervention equipment.",Verb,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tag
tension-set packer,"A type of packer that is set by applying tension to the running string. These packers are less common than compression-set packers due to the potential difficulties associated with retrieval. However, in applications where there is insufficient string weight to set a compression packer, a tension packer is a useful option.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tension-set_packer

tubing performance curve (TPC),A mathematical tool used in production engineering to assess the performance of the completion string by plotting the surface production rate against the flowing bottomhole pressure. The fluid composition and behavior of the fluid phases in the specific completion design will determine the shape of the curve. The TPC is used with the inflow performance relationship to predict the performance of a specific well.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tubing_performance_curve_tpc
tubing joint,"A single length of the pipe that is assembled to provide a conduit through which the oil or gas will be produced from a wellbore. Tubing joints are generally around 30 ft [9 m] long with a thread connection on each end. The specification of the tubing material, geometry of the tubing, and design of the connection thread are selected to suit the reservoir fluid and wellbore conditions.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tubing_joint
turbulent flow,"A fluid-flow regime characterized by swirling or chaotic motion as the fluid moves along the pipe or conduit. The linear velocity of the fluid particles is similar regardless of position in the conduit, although particles close to the conduit walls have a lower velocity. This characteristic makes turbulent flow an efficient flow regime for the pickup and transport of solids. However, the potential for erosion may be significant, especially with abrasive fluids and a tortuous flow path.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/turbulent_flow
tubing puncher,"A special perforating gun, or charge, that is designed for limited penetration to allow an inner tubing or casing string to be perforated without damaging a surrounding outer string.

thread rule,A pocket-size thread gauge used in field operations to correctly identify or confirm the thread type and size of tubular goods.,Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thread_rule
thread protector,"A cheap, expendable, perhaps even disposable threaded shape to mate with threads on drillstring and casing components. Thread protectors prevent harmful impacts and other contact to the metal thread surfaces. Some protectors are strong enough and are fitted with lifting eyes so that they may be screwed into a joint of drillpipe, a drill collar or another component and a chain tied to the eye for lifting the joint. Except for this type, most of the other available styles of thread protectors are relatively inexpensive, being made from thermoplastics and various epoxy resins.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thread_protector
tieback liner,"A section of liner that is run from a liner hanger back to the wellhead after the initial liner and hanger system have been installed and cemented. A tieback liner may be required to provide the necessary pressure capacity during a flow-test period or for special treatments, and is typically not cemented in place. In some cases, a tieback liner will be installed as a remedial treatment when the integrity of the intermediate casing string is in doubt.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tie-back_liner
through-flowline (TFL),"Pertaining to treatments performed on subsea wells where the fluids and associated pump-down equipment, such as plugs or darts, are pumped through the flowline normally used for production fluids.",Adjective,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/through-flowline_tfl
tieback string,"Another term for tieback liner, a section of liner that is run from a liner hanger back to the wellhead after the initial liner and hanger system have been installed and cemented. A tieback liner may be required to provide the necessary pressure capacity during a flow-test period or for special treatments, and is typically not cemented in place. In some cases, a tieback liner will be installed as a remedial treatment when the integrity of the intermediate casing string is in doubt.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tie-back_string
tieback packer,"A specially designed packer assembly used in conjunction with a tieback liner. The tieback packer can be integral to the original liner hanger, or if the tieback is a remedial treatment, it can be a separate component set above the liner hanger.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tie-back_packer
through-tubing,"Pertaining to any reservoir or wellbore treatment performed through the tubing string. Through-tubing treatments are generally associated with live-well operations, thereby causing minimal interruption to production and eliminating the need to kill the well.",Adjective,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/through-tubing
tally,"A list containing details of tubulars that have been prepared for running, or that have been retrieved from the wellbore. Each tubing joint is numbered and the corresponding length and other pertinent details noted alongside.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tally

microseismic monitoring,"A technique to track the propagation of a hydraulic fracture as it advances through a formation. Microseisms are detected, located, and displayed in time for scientists and engineers to approximate the location and propagation of the hydraulic fracture. Software provides modeling, survey design, microseismic detection and location, uncertainty analysis, data integration, and visualization for interpretation. Computer imagery is used to monitor the activity in 3D space relative to the location of the fracturing treatment. The monitored activities are animated to show progressive fracture growth and the subsurface response to pumping variations. When displayed in real time, the microseismic activity allows one to make changes to the stimulation design to ensure optimal reservoir contact. Also known as hydraulic fracture monitoring, this technique delivers information about the effectiveness of the stimulation of a reservoir that can be used to enhance reservoir development in shale gas completions.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/microseismic_monitoring
matrix acidizing,"The treatment of a reservoir formation with a stimulation fluid containing a reactive acid. In sandstone formations, the acid reacts with the soluble substances in the formation matrix to enlarge the pore spaces. In carbonate formations, the acid dissolves the entire formation matrix. In each case, the matrix acidizing treatment improves the formation permeability to enable enhanced production of reservoir fluids. Matrix acidizing operations are ideally performed at high rate, but at treatment pressures below the fracture pressure of the formation. This enables the acid to penetrate the formation and extend the depth of treatment while avoiding damage to the reservoir formation.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/matrix_acidizing
marginal well,"A well that, for reasons of depletion or natural low productivity, is nearing the limits of viable production and profitability.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/marginal_well
microannulus,"A small gap that can form between the casing or liner and the surrounding cement sheath, most commonly formed by variations in temperature or pressure during or after the cementing process. Such variations cause small movement of the steel casing, breaking the cement bond and creating a microannulus that is typically partial. However, in severe cases the microannulus may encircle the entire casing circumference. A microannulus can jeopardize the hydraulic efficiency of a primary cementing operation, allowing communication between zones if it is severe and connected.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/microannulus
make up,To tighten threaded connections.,Verb,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/make_up
master valve,"A valve located on the Christmas tree that controls all flow from the wellbore. A correctly functioning master valve is so important that two master valves are fitted to most Christmas trees. The upper master valve is used on a routine basis, with the lower master valve providing backup or contingency function in the event that the normal service valve is leaking and needs replacement.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/master_valve
manifold,"An arrangement of piping or valves designed to control, distribute and typically monitor fluid flow. Manifolds are often configured for specific functions, such as a choke manifold used in well control operations, a frac manifold for directing treatment fluid, and a squeeze manifold used in squeeze-cementing work. In each case, the functional requirements of the operation have been addressed in the configuration of the manifold and the degree of control and instrumentation required.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/manifold
matrix stimulation,"A treatment designed to treat the near-wellbore reservoir formation rather than other areas of the production conduit, such as the casing across the production interval, production tubulars or the perforations. Matrix stimulation treatments include acid, solvent and chemical treatments to improve the permeability of the near-wellbore formation, enhancing the productivity of a well. Matrix stimulation is a process of injecting a fluid into the formation, either an acid or solvent at pressures below the fracturing pressure, to improve the production or injection flow capacity of a well. The goal of a matrix treatment is different in sandstones than in carbonates. In sandstones, matrix treatments restore or improve the natural formation permeability around the wellbore by removing formation damage, by dissolving material plugging the pores or by enlarging the pore spaces. In carbonates, matrix stimulation creates new, highly conductive channels (wormholes) that bypass damage. Because of these differences, the selection criteria for the treating fluid are also distinct. For sandstone treatments, knowledge of the extent, type of damage, location, origin, reservoir mineralogy (petrographic study) and compatibility of the treating fluid with the formation are especially important. In carbonate treatments, reservoir temperature, pumping rate and fluid type become more significant because these parameters directly affect the reactivity of the treating fluid with the reservoir rock. A sandstone matrix stimulation treatment is generally composed of a hydrochloric acid [HCl] preflush, a main treating fluid (HCl-HF mixtures) and an overflush (weak acid solution or brine). The treating fluid is maintained under pressure inside the reservoir for a period of time, after which the well is swabbed and returned to production. In carbonate reservoirs, HCl is the most common fluid used. Organic acids such as formic and acetic acid are used in either sandstone or carbonate acidizing, mainly in retarded-acid systems or in high-temperature applications. Matrix stimulation is also called matrix treatment or matrix acidizing.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/matrix_stimulation
mud acid,"A mixture of hydrofluoric acid [HF] and hydrochloric acid [HCl] or organic acid used as the main fluid in a sandstone matrix treatment. Hydrochloric acid or organic acid is mixed with HF to keep the pH low when it spends, thereby preventing detrimental precipitates. The name mud acid was given to these mixtures because they were originally developed to treat damage from siliceous drilling muds. Mud acid is also called hydrofluoric-hydrochloric acid.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mud_acid
multiple completion,"A single wellbore having tubulars and equipment that enable production from two or more reservoir zones. In most cases, at least two tubing strings will be used to provide the necessary level of control and safety for production fluids. However, in some simple dual completions, the second or upper zone is produced up the tubing-casing annulus. The wellhead and surface flow-control facilities required for multiple completions can be complex and costly; hence, multiple completions are relatively uncommon.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiple_completion
multiphase fluid,"A fluid, generally a liquid, comprising more than one phase, such as water- or oil-based liquids, solid material or gas. Multiphase fluids and their behavior are of concern in two main areas, the flow of multiphase fluids and the separation of the various phases at surface.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiphase_fluid
mist flow,"A multiphase fluid-flow regime characterized by the gas phase being distributed as bubbles through the liquid phase. In a producing wellbore where the bubbles are uniformly distributed, there is little relative motion between the phases. Where the bubbles congregate and combine to form a less uniform distribution of the gas phase, some slippage will occur between the phases with the gas tending to cut through the liquid phase.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mist_flow
multiphase fluid flow,"The commingled flow of different phase fluids, such as water, oil and gas. Multiphase fluid flow is a complex factor, important in understanding and optimizing production hydraulics in both oil and gas wells. Four multiphase fluid flow regimes are recognized when describing flow in oil and gas wells, bubble flow, slug flow, transition flow and mist flow.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiphase_fluid_flow
missile,"Flow control unit used in the pressurization of fluid employed in hydraulic fracturing. Fracturing fluid enters the missile at low pressure and is directed to the pump trucks for pressurization. High-pressure fluid returns to the missile and is directed to the well or, in the case of a multiwell pad, to a frac manifold.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/missile
minimum restriction,"The smallest diameter present in a wellbore through which a tool string must pass to enable access to the operating depth or zone of interest. The minimum restriction determines the maximum tool string outside diameter and may influence the configuration of the assembled tools or equipment. The minimum restriction should be considered in both running and retrieving modes if any increase in tool string outside diameter is likely, such as when perforating or when using inflatable packers.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/minimum_restriction
