geochemistry,"The study of the chemistry of the Earth and within solid bodies of the solar system, including the distribution, circulation and abundance of elements (and their ions and isotopes), molecules, minerals, rocks and fluids. For geochemists in the petroleum industry, source rock geochemistry is a major focus. Geochemical techniques can determine whether a given source rock is rich enough in organic matter to generate hydrocarbons, whether the source rock has generated hydrocarbons, and whether a particular oil sample was generated by a given source rock.",Noun,Geochemistry,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/geochemistry
kerogen,"The naturally occurring, solid, insoluble organic matter that occurs in source rocks and can yield oil upon heating. Kerogen is the portion of naturally occurring organic matter that is nonextractable using organic solvents. Typical organic constituents of kerogen are algae and woody plant material. Kerogens have a high molecular weight relative to bitumen, or soluble organic matter. Bitumen forms from kerogen during petroleum generation. Kerogens are described as Type I, consisting of mainly algal and amorphous (but presumably algal) kerogen and highly likely to generate oil; Type II, mixed terrestrial and marine source material that can generate waxy oil; and Type III, woody terrestrial source material that typically generates gas.",Noun,Geochemistry,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/k/kerogen
pyrolysis,"A type of geochemical analysis in which a rock sample is subject to controlled heating in an inert gas to or past the point of generating hydrocarbons in order to assess its quality as a source rock, the abundance of organic material in it, its thermal maturity, and the quality of hydrocarbons it might generate or have generated. Pyrolysis breaks large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules. This process is used to determine the quality of shale as a source rock and is instrumental in evaluating shale gas plays.",Noun,Geochemistry,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pyrolysis
source rock,"A rock rich in organic matter which, if heated sufficiently, will generate oil or gas. Typical source rocks, usually shales or limestones, contain about 1% organic matter and at least 0.5% total organic carbon (TOC), although a rich source rock might have as much as 10% organic matter. Rocks of marine origin tend to be oil-prone, whereas terrestrial source rocks (such as coal) tend to be gas-prone. Preservation of organic matter without degradation is critical to creating a good source rock, and necessary for a complete petroleum system. Under the right conditions, source rocks may also be reservoir rocks, as in the case of shale gas reservoirs.",Noun,Geochemistry,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/source_rock
