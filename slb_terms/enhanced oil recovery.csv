erosion-corrosion,"A type of corrosion produced when easily removed scales (such as iron carbonate) that were initially protecting the metals in the pipe are eroded and the underlying metals are corroded. Erosion-corrosion is a common cause of failure in oilfield equipment. The attack is normally localized at changes of pipe sections, bends or elbows where there is high velocity or turbulent flow.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/erosion-corrosion
equation of state,"An equation that specifies fluid density as a function of pressure and temperature. A large body of scientific literature describes these functions for all kinds of hydrocarbons, and also for complex mixes of various hydrocarbons with other hydrocarbons and with other fluids. Once the components of a reservoir fluid are determined, the known hydrocarbon properties become a valuable tool in making further calculations of well-test results and predictions of future well and reservoir behavior.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/equation_of_state
electrical double layer,"With reference to formation evaluation, the layer between a clay particle and the formation water that has a particular distribution of ions. Clays have an excess negative charge on their surface. When in contact with formation water, this charge attracts an excess of positive cations, normally Na+ together with their molecules of hydration water, into a region near the interface. The layer next to the clay surface, the Stern layer, has no anions, and is always present. Outside the Stern layer is the Gouy layer, through which the ion concentration gradually approaches that of free brine. The thickness of this layer increases as brine salinity decreases.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electrical_double_layer
electrical resistance probe,"An instrument used in a corrosion testing to determine metal loss. The probe directly measures the increase in resistance of a metal as its cross-sectional area is reduced by corrosion. At suitable times, once the readings are obtained, these numbers are converted into corrosion rates (mpy). An electrical resistance probe is also called an electrical coupon.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electrical_resistance_probe
five-spot,"An injection pattern in which four input or injection wells are located at the corners of a square and the production well sits in the center. The injection fluid, which is normally water, steam or gas, is injected simultaneously through the four injection wells to displace the oil toward the central production well.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/five-spot
fireflooding,"A method of thermal recovery in which a flame front is generated in the reservoir by igniting a fire at the sandface of an injection well. Continuous injection of air or other gas mixture with high oxygen content will maintain the flame front. As the fire burns, it moves through the reservoir toward production wells. Heat from the fire reduces oil viscosity and helps vaporize reservoir water to steam. The steam, hot water, combustion gas and a bank of distilled solvent all act to drive oil in front of the fire toward production wells.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fireflooding
fingering,"A condition whereby the interface of two fluids, such as oil and water, bypasses sections of reservoir as it moves along, creating an uneven, or fingered, profile. Fingering is a relatively common condition in reservoirs with water-injection wells. The result of fingering is an inefficient sweeping action that can bypass significant volumes of recoverable oil and, in severe cases, an early breakthrough of water into adjacent production wellbores.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fingering
flooding pattern,"Also known as injection pattern, the particular arrangement of production and injection wells. The injection pattern for an individual field or part of a field is based on the location of existing wells, reservoir size and shape, cost of new wells and the recovery increase associated with various injection patterns. The flood pattern can be altered during the life of a field to change the direction of flow in a reservoir with the intent of contacting unswept oil. It is common to reduce the pattern size by infill drilling, which improves oil recovery by increasing reservoir continuity between injectors and producers. Common injection patterns are direct line drive, staggered line drive, two-spot, three-spot, four-spot, five-spot, seven-spot and nine-spot. Normally, the two-spot and three-spot patterns are used for pilot testing purposes. The patterns are called normal or regular when they include only one production well per pattern. Patterns are described as inverted when they include only one injection well per pattern.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flooding_pattern
first-contact miscibility,"A condition of two fluids that are miscible that is, they form a single phase when mixed in any proportion when first brought into contact at a given pressure and temperature. In reservoir gasflooding, the injected gas composition, oil composition, temperature, and the injection pressure determine the condition of first-contact miscibility. In contrast, fluids that develop miscibility after exchanging components have multiple-contact miscibility.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/first-contact_miscibility
flood front,The interface between an injectant and the fluid it is displacing.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flood_front
ferrous sulfide,"A corrosion by-product [FeS2] formed when hydrogen sulfide [H2S] contacts the iron [Fe] present in steel. Ferrous sulfide is a black crystalline material at bottomhole conditions. However, when it contacts air at surface, it will be converted into iron oxide, which is a red-brown compound. Ferrous sulfide is also called iron sulfide.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/ferrous_sulfide
forward multiple-contact test,"A laboratory test to determine the phase envelope between lean gas and oil by equilibrating a gas sample several times with fresh samples of oil. In a forward-contact test, light and intermediate components are stripped from the oil by multiple contacts with the gas. The test also indicates how many contacts are required before the gas with added components becomes miscible with the oil. The molar ratios at each contact step are typically designed using PVT simulation software that incorporates the fluid composition at each contact.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/forward_multiple-contact_test
fracture acidizing,"A well-stimulation operation in which acid, usually hydrochloric [HCl], is injected into a carbonate formation at a pressure above the formation-fracturing pressure. Flowing acid tends to etch the fracture faces in a nonuniform pattern, forming conductive channels that remain open without a propping agent after the fracture closes. The length of the etched fracture limits the effectiveness of an acid-fracture treatment. The fracture length depends on acid leakoff and acid spending. If acid fluid-loss characteristics are poor, excessive leakoff will terminate fracture extension. Similarly, if the acid spends too rapidly, the etched portion of the fracture will be too short. The major problem in fracture acidizing is the development of wormholes in the fracture face; these wormholes increase the reactive surface area and cause excessive leakoff and rapid spending of the acid. To some extent, this problem can be overcome by using inert fluid-loss additives to bridge wormholes or by using viscosified acids. Fracture acidizing is also called acid fracturing or acid-fracture treatment.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracture_acidizing
formic acid,"An organic acid used in the stimulation of high-temperature oil and gas wells in which conventional hydrochloric acid systems cannot be adequately inhibited, or where contact time with tubulars is likely to be extended.",Noun,Well Workover and Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formic_acid
flue gas,"A gas generated by burning hydrocarbons with air; it is sometimes used as an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) injectant. The composition consists mainly of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapor and excess oxygen with some impurities, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. Generally, more carbon dioxide in the flue gas results in a better recovery factor for EOR. By contrast, using more nitrogen results in a lower recovery factor for EOR. However, high concentration of impurities, such as oxygen, nitrous oxides and carbon monoxide, can cause corrosion in production tubulars and surface equipment.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flue_gas
formation damage,"Alteration of the far-field or virgin characteristics of a producing formation, usually by exposure to drilling fluids. The water or solid particles in the drilling fluids, or both, tend to decrease the pore volume and effective permeability of the producible formation in the near-wellbore region. At least two mechanisms are at work. First, solid particles from the drilling fluid physically plug or bridge across flowpaths in the porous formation. Second, when water contacts certain clay minerals in the formation, the clay typically swells, increasing in volume and decreasing the pore volume. Third, chemical reactions between the drilling fluid and the formation rock and fluids can precipitate solids or semisolids that plug pore spaces. One approach to minimize formation damage is to use drill-in or completion fluids that are specially formulated to avoid damage to the formation when drilling pay zones, rather than ordinary drilling fluids.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_damage
foam flooding,"An enhanced oil recovery process in which foam is injected into a reservoir to improve the sweep efficiency of a driving fluid. Foam can be generated either in the reservoir pore space or at the surface before injection. Foam flooding mitigates sweep inhomogeneities such as those caused by layers with higher permeability than the surrounding formations, or those caused by gravity override.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/foam_flooding
fluoboric acid,"An acid mixture that generates more hydrofluoric [HF] acid as the HF is consumed. In the field, fluoboric acid [HBF4] is easily prepared by mixing boric acid [H3BO3], ammonium bifluoride [NH3F.HF] and hydrochloric acid. Fluoboric acid was developed to counteract the shortcomings associated with mud-acid treatments. It is a retarded fluid that can penetrate deep into the reservoir before spending, especially at high temperatures, and does not contain high HF at any given time. Thus, it is less reactive than mud acid, but its total dissolving power is comparable: HBF4 + H3O --> HBF3OH + HF. The limited amount of HF at any given time decreases the probability of forming precipitates of fluosilicates, fluoaluminates or silica. Fluoboric acid provides permanent stabilization of clays and fines through reactions related to borate and fluoborate ions. For example, borosilicates coat and bind undissolved clays and fines, preventing further mobility of these particles that might plug the formation and impair production. Mud acid does not provide this coating feature. Fluoboric acid also eliminates water sensitivity and is especially recommended in formations containing potassium minerals. Fluoboric acid can be used as a preflush, an overflush or as a main stage in a sandstone matrix acidizing. As a main fluid, a fluoboric acid treatment requires a preflush (weak HCl acid or brine) and should not be overflushed to obtain the maximum stabilization effect in the critical matrix area. Fluoboric acid treatments are the only acid formulations that require long shut-in times because of their long reaction times.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fluoboric_acid
foaming agent,"An additive used in preparation of foam used as a drilling fluid. Drilling foam is water containing air or gas bubbles, much like shaving foam, and it must withstand high salinity, hard water, solids, entrained oil and high temperature. Foaming agents are usually nonionic surfactants and contain polymeric materials.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/foaming_agent
gas-cap drive,A type of reservoir-drive mechanism in which the energy for the transport and production of reservoir fluids is provided by the expansion of gas either in the gas cap or inside the oil phase.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gas-cap_drive
galvanic anodes,"Materials used to provide cathodic protection. Galvanic anodes are made of metals such as zinc, magnesium or aluminum, which corrode more easily than the structure, thus developing enough electric current flow through the electrolyte (such as soils or water). Galvanic anodes, also called sacrificial anodes, are commonly used when the current required for cathodic protection is small.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/galvanic_anodes
gravity override,"A phenomenon of multiphase flow in a reservoir in which a less dense fluid flows preferentially on the top of a reservoir unit and a more dense fluid flows at the bottom. For example, in a steamflood, steam flows on the top and condensed liquid flows at the bottom of the zone. Gravity override causes sweep inhomogeneities that can be mitigated through foam flooding.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gravity_override
gravity drainage,"The least common primary recovery mechanism in which the force of gravity pushes hydrocarbons out of the reservoir, into the wellbore and up to surface. Gravity force is always present in the reservoir, but its effect is greater in thick gas-condensate reservoirs and in shallow, highly permeable, steeply dipping reservoirs.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gravity_drainage
gravity-stable displacement,"A frontal advance in which gravity and viscous forces are in equilibrium, resulting in a stable, highly efficient frontal advance.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gravity-stable_displacement
high-pressure air injection,"An enhanced oil recovery process utilizing compressed air that is injected into a reservoir. Oxygen in the gas reacts exothermically with some of the oil, producing highly mobile flue gas. The flue gas advances ahead of the reaction front and achieves an efficient displacement of the in situ oil. Scientists believe that the high displacement efficiency of high-pressure air injection is due to a combination of processes that include immiscible gas displacement, improved miscibility caused by the presence of CO2 in the flue gas, reduction in interfacial tension, oil swelling and reservoir repressurization. The process is typically used for deep, tight, relatively light-oil reservoirs where water injectivity is low.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/high-pressure_air_injection
hydrogen-induced failures,"A type of corrosion produced when a metal absorbs hydrogen atoms. This phenomenon can cause undesirable effects such as blistering, cracking, methane formation above 400 degF [204 degC], and hydrogen embrittlement.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrogen_induced_failures
hydrophile-lipophile balance number,"A number on the scale of one to 40 according to the HLB system, introduced by Griffin (1949 and 1954). The HLB system is a semi-empirical method to predict what type of surfactant properties a molecular structure will provide. The HLB system is based on the concept that some molecules have hydrophilic groups, other molecules have lipophilic groups, and some have both. Weight percentage of each type of group on a molecule or in a mixture predicts what behavior the molecular structure will exhibit. Water-in-oil emulsifiers have a low HLB numbers, typically around 4. Solubilizing agents have high HLB numbers. Oil-in-water emulsifiers have intermediate to high HLB numbers.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrophile-lipophile_balance_number
hydrophobic,Pertaining to a repulsion of water by the surface of a material or a molecule.,Adjective,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrophobic
hydrophilic,"Pertaining to an attraction for water by the surface of a material or a molecule. Clays and most other natural minerals used in drilling fluids, such as barite and hematite, are hydrophilic. They are spontaneously wet by water. To render them oleophilic, they can be treated with an oil-wetting chemical.",Adjective,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrophilic
hydrogen probe,"A corrosion test instrument mainly used in sour systems (for example, hydrogen sulfide or other sulfide rich environments) to determine qualitatively or semiquantitatively the corrosion of a structure. A hydrogen probe is also called a hydrogen patch probe.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrogen_probe
hot waterflooding,"A method of thermal recovery in which hot water is injected into a reservoir through specially distributed injection wells. Hot waterflooding reduces the viscosity of the crude oil, allowing it to move more easily toward production wells. Hot waterflooding, also known as hot water injection, is typically less effective than a steam-injection process because water has lower heat content than steam. Nevertheless, it is preferable under certain conditions such as formation sensitivity to fresh water.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hot_waterflooding
huff and puff,"Slang term for a cyclic process in which a well is injected with a recovery enhancement fluid and, after a soak period, the well is put back on production. Examples are cyclic steam injection and cyclic CO2 injection.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/huff_and_puff
HCl,The chemical formula for the compound hydrogen chloride. A solution of hydrogen chloride [HCl] in water is hydrochloric acid.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hcl
heavy oil,"Crude oil with high viscosity (typically above 10 cP), and high specific gravity. The API classifies heavy oil as crudes with a gravity below 22.3° API. In addition to high viscosity and high specific gravity, heavy oils typically have low hydrogen-to-carbon ratios; high asphaltene, sulfur, nitrogen, and heavy-metal content; and higher acid numbers.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/heavy_oil
hydrofluoric acid,"A poisonous liquid acid composed of hydrogen and fluorine. Hydrofluoric acid [HF] is used primarily because it is the only common, inexpensive mineral acid that can dissolve siliceous minerals. HF is typically mixed with hydrochloric acid [HCl] or organic acid to keep the pH low when it spends, thereby preventing detrimental precipitates. These mixtures, also called mud acids, are considered the main fluid in a sandstone acid treatment because they remove formation damage. Hydrofluoric acid should not be used in sandstone formations with high carbonate content because of the high risk of calcium fluoride precipitation [CaF2].",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrofluoric_acid
hydrogen blistering,"A type of hydrogen-induced failure produced when hydrogen atoms enter low-strength steels that have macroscopic defects, such as laminations. The defects in the steel (void spaces) provide places for hydrogen atoms to combine, forming gaseous molecular hydrogen [H2] that can build enough pressure to produce blistering. Hydrogen blistering is a problem mainly in sour environments. Frequently, it does not cause a brittle failure, but it can produce rupture or leakages.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrogen_blistering
hydrogen embrittlement,"The process whereby hydrogen causes steel components to become less resistant to breakage and generally much weaker in tensile strength. While embrittlement has many causes, in the oil field it is usually the result of exposure to gaseous or liquid hydrogen sulfide [H2S]. On a molecular level, hydrogen ions work their way between the grain boundaries of the steel, where hydrogen ions recombine into molecular hydrogen [H2], taking up more space and weakening the bonds between the grains. The formation of molecular hydrogen can cause sudden metal failure due to cracking when the metal is subjected to tensile stress. This type of hydrogen-induced failure is produced when hydrogen atoms enter high strength steels. The failures due to hydrogen embrittlement normally have a period where no damage is observed, which is called incubation, followed by a sudden catastrophic failure. Hydrogen embrittlement is also called acid brittleness.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrogen_embrittlement
bimetallic corrosion,"A type of corrosion in which two different metals are placed in contact in a corrosive environment. A small electric current flows from one piece of metal to the other, accelerating the corrosion rate of the more reactive of the two metals. Bimetallic corrosion is sometimes found when new pipe is added to old pipelines. The old pipeline covered by oxide and rust is cathodic to the new pipe, thus accelerating the corrosion rate in the new pipe. Another type of bimetallic corrosion is ringworm corrosion.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bimetallic_corrosion
backward multiple-contact test,A laboratory test to determine the phase envelope between oil and enriched gas. The test is conducted by equilibrating an oil sample several times with fresh samples of gas. Intermediate components are stripped from the gas by multiple contacts with the oil. The test also indicates how many contacts are required before the oil with added intermediate components becomes miscible with the gas. The molar ratios at each contact step are typically designed using PVT simulation software that incorporates the fluid composition from the previous contact.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/backward_multiple-contact_test
brownfield,"An oil or gas accumulation that has matured to a production plateau or even progressed to a stage of declining production. Operating companies seek to extend the economic producing life of the field using cost-effective, low-risk technologies. Stimulation or refracturing operations, completing additional zones, and installing artificial lift equipment are a few technologies commonly applied in brownfields before any drilling options are attempted.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/brownfield
batch treatment,"The pumping of a specific amount of treatment fluid, such as cement slurry, stimulation fluid, well completion fluid, or chemical corrosion inhibitor. In corrosion control, there are several batch-treating techniques, such as tubing displacement and standard batch treatments, which are used to place the corrosion inhibitor in an oil or gas well.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/batch_treatment
breakthrough,"A description of reservoir conditions under which a fluid, previously isolated or separated from production, gains access to a producing wellbore. The term is most commonly applied to water or gas breakthrough, where the water or gas injected to maintain reservoir pressure via injection wells breaks through to one or more of the producing wells.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/breakthrough
bubblepoint,"The pressure and temperature conditions at which the first bubble of gas comes out of solution in oil. At discovery, all petroleum reservoir oils contain some natural gas in solution. Often the oil is saturated with gas when discovered, meaning that the oil is holding all the gas it can at the reservoir temperature and pressure, and that it is at its bubblepoint. Occasionally, the oil will be undersaturated. In this case, as the pressure is lowered, the pressure at which the first gas begins to evolve from the oil is defined as the bubblepoint.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bubblepoint
Bond number,"A dimensionless group used in analysis of fluid flow that characterizes the ratio of gravitational forces to surface or interfacial tension forces. It is usually denoted Nb in the oil field and Bo in chemical engineering. A value of Nb <<1 implies the flow in question is only weakly dependent on gravitational forces, whereas Nb >>1 implies gravitational forces dominate over interfacial forces.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bond_number
clay swelling,"A type of damage in which formation permeability is reduced because of the alteration of clay equilibrium. Clay swelling occurs when water-base filtrates from drilling, completion, workover or stimulation fluids enter the formation. Clay swelling can be caused by ion exchange or changes in salinity. However, only clays that are directly contacted by the fluid moving in the rock will react; these include authigenic clays, some detrital clays on the pore boundaries and unprotected clay cement. The nature of the reaction depends on the structure of the clays and their chemical state at the moment of contact. The most common swelling clays are smectite and smectite mixtures that create an almost impermeable barrier for fluid flow when they are located in the larger pores of a reservoir rock. In some cases, brines such as potassium chloride [KCl] are used in completion or workover operations to avoid clay swelling.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/clay_swelling
corrosion control,"The measures used to prevent or considerably reduce the effects of corrosion. Corrosion can occur anywhere in the production system, either at bottomhole or in surface lines and equipment. Some practices for corrosion control involve: cathodic protection, chemical inhibition, chemical control (removal of dissolved gases such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and oxygen), oxygen scavenging, pH adjustment, deposition control (for example, scales) and coatings. One of the most difficult environments for corrosion control is high bottomhole temperatures, such as 400 to 500 degF [200 to 260 degC]. The corrosion rate will vary with time depending on the particular conditions of the oil field, such as the amount of water produced, secondary recovery operations and pressure variations. Therefore, corrosion control is a continuous process in oil and gas production operations.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/corrosion_control
corrosion rate,"The weight loss of a corrosion coupon after exposure to a corrosive environment, expressed as mils (thousandths of an inch) per year penetration. Corrosion rate is calculated assuming uniform corrosion over the entire surface of the coupon. mpy = (weight loss in grams) * (22,300)/(Adt) mpy = corrosion rate (mils per year penetration) A = area of coupon (sq. in.) d = metal density of coupon (g/cm3) t = time of exposure in corrosive environment (days). It is important to note that the calculated values using this formula are not representative in cases of severe pitting. Therefore, a complete report, including a visual inspection, is required to determine either the type of attack or the appropriate corrosion control program. Corrosion rate is also known as corrosion ratio.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/corrosion_rate
corrosion inhibitor,A chemical additive used in acid treatments to protect iron and steel components in the wellbore and treating equipment from the corrosive treating fluid. Corrosion inhibitors generally are mixed with the treatment fluid and are formulated to be effective in protecting the metal components the fluid is likely to contact. This protection must remain effective under the anticipated pressure and temperature environment for the duration of the treatment.,Noun,Well Workover and Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/corrosion_inhibitor
corrosion fatigue,"A type of corrosion in which the metal components of a structure fail due to cyclic stresses applied in a corrosive environment, such as salt water. Consequently, a break in the metal will occur at stresses considerably lower than the tensile strength of the material. Corrosion fatigue is the main cause of sucker-rod and drillstring failures.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/corrosion_fatigue
cosurfactant,"A chemical added to a process to enhance the effectiveness of a surfactant. In the oil industry, cosurfactants are often used to increase the oil-solubilizing capacity of microemulsion surfactant systems. An example of such a cosurfactant is a long-chain alcohol. Pure surfactants often organize well at a liquid/liquid boundary, which leads to relatively stiff interfaces or even liquid-crystal phases. To achieve ultralow interfacial tension for enhanced oil recovery applications, a cosurfactant is added to disturb this organization at the liquid/liquid interface. Cosurfactants can also be used to fine-tune the formulation phase behavior, for example, by expanding the temperature or salinity range of microemulsion formation.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cosurfactant
cathodic protection,"A technique used to minimize the rate of corrosion of a structure. Cathodic protection does not eliminate corrosion; it transfers corrosion from the structure under protection to a known location where artificial anodes (plates or metal bars) are placed and could be replaced easily. Cathodic protection is used for floating vessels, platforms, storage tanks, and pipelines.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cathodic_protection
coating,"Any thin material, liquid or powder, which, applied over a structure, forms a continuous film to protect against corrosion. Corrosion coatings should possess flexibility, resistance against impact and moisture, good adhesion and cohesion, and chemical resistance to the exposure conditions (such as temperature, hydrogen sulfide). Organic coatings such as polyethylenes (plastic) are normally used for external protection of pipelines while asphalt and coal tar enamels are used to protect buried pipes or undersides of oilfield tanks. Inorganic coating such as zinc-silicate is used to protect drilling and production platforms above the splash zone and nickel phosphate coating is used to protect packer body parts.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/coating
corrosion,"The loss of metal due to chemical or electrochemical reactions, which could eventually destroy a structure. Corrosion can occur anywhere in the production system, either at bottomhole or in surface lines and equipment. The corrosion rate will vary with time depending on the particular conditions of the oil field, such as the amount of water produced, secondary recovery operations and pressure variations.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/corrosion
cosolvent,A chemical used in small quantities to improve the effectiveness of a primary solvent in a chemical process.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cosolvent
chemical injection,"A general term for injection processes that use special chemical solutions to improve oil recovery, remove formation damage, clean blocked perforations or formation layers, reduce or inhibit corrosion, upgrade crude oil, or address crude oil flow-assurance issues. Injection can be administered continuously, in batches, in injection wells, or at times in production wells.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/chemical_injection
chemical flooding,"A general term for injection processes that use special chemical solutions. Micellar, alkaline and soap-like substances are used to reduce surface tension between oil and water in the reservoir, whereas polymers such as polyacrylamide or polysaccharide are employed to improve sweep efficiency. The chemical solutions are pumped through specially distributed injection wells to mobilize oil left behind after primary or secondary recovery. Chemical flooding is a major component of enhanced oil recovery processes and can be subdivided into micellar-polymer flooding and alkaline flooding. The general procedure of a chemical flooding includes a preflush (low-salinity water), a chemical solution (micellar or alkaline), a mobility buffer and, finally, a driving fluid (water), which displaces the chemicals and the resulting oil bank to production wells. The preflush and the mobility buffer are optional fluids.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/chemical_flooding
CO2 injection,An enhanced oil recovery method in which carbon dioxide (CO2) is injected into a reservoir to increase production by reducing oil viscosity and providing miscible or partially miscible displacement of the oil.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/co2_injection
critical matrix,A near-wellbore area where injected fluids such as acids can restore original permeability. Most of the reservoir pressure drop during production occurs in this near-wellbore part of the reservoir.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/critical_matrix
coreflooding,"A laboratory test in which a fluid or combination of fluids is injected into a sample of rock. Objectives include measurement of permeability, relative permeability, saturation change, formation damage caused by the fluid injection, or interactions between the fluid and the rock. The core material often comes from an oil reservoir, but some tests use outcrop rock. The fluid in place at the start of the test is typically either a simulated formation brine, oil (either crude oil or refined oil), or a combination of brine and oil. Injected fluids may include crude oil, simulated reservoir brine, refined fluids, drilling mud filtrate, acids, foam or other chemicals used in the oil field. Depending on the purpose of the test, conditions may be either ambient temperature and low confining pressure or high temperature and pressure of a subject reservoir. Pressures and flow rates at both ends of the core are measured, and the core can also be investigated using other measurements such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) during the test. A coreflood is typically used to determine the optimum development option for an oil reservoir and often helps evaluate the effect of injecting fluids specially designed to improve or enhance oil recovery.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/coreflooding
crosswell tomography,"A technique for measuring a signal that is broadcast from a transmitter or source located in one well, to a receiver array placed in a neighboring well. This technique is used to create a display of formation properties such as acoustic velocity and attenuation, seismic reflectivity, or electromagnetic resistivity in the area between wells. The reservoir-scale data acquired with this technique can be used to bridge the gap between wellbore measurements and surface measurements.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/crosswell_tomography
COFCAW,"Abbreviation for a combination of forward combustion and waterflooding, also called wet combustion or in situ steam generation. COFCAW is an in situ combustion technique in which water is injected simultaneously or alternately with air into a formation. Wet combustion actually refers to wet forward combustion and was developed to use the great amount of heat that would otherwise be lost in the formation. The injected water recovers the heat from behind the burning front and transfers it to the oil bank ahead. Because of this additional energy, the oil displacement is more efficient and requires less air. In spite of these advantages, a wet combustion process cannot avoid liquid-blocking problems and use of wet combustion is limited by the oil viscosity.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cofcaw
constant composition expansion,A laboratory test usually performed as part of a routine PVT analysis that measures the change in volume of a reservoir fluid as a function of pressure. This change is determined by measuring the total volume of a sample of reservoir fluid at various pressures above and below the saturation pressure. The pressure-dependent volumes are normalized to the volume of the sample at the saturation pressure.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/constant_composition_expansion
contact angle,"The angle of intersection of the interface between two fluids at a solid surface. The angle is measured from the solid surface through the aqueous phase, or in an oil and gas test through the oil phase. The contact angle displays hysteresis based on direction of motion of the interface. Surface roughness affects the equilibrium contact angle, so measurements are typically made on smooth, flat surfaces. A contact-angle test uses carefully captured and preserved samples of reservoir oil to determine the wetting preference. A droplet of the crude oil is suspended between two parallel plates of quartz or calcite inside a simulated formation water bath at reservoir temperature and sometimes at reservoir pressure. By periodically displacing one of the plates sideways, a contact angle is determined at the side of the droplet where water is forcing the oil from the solid. A small angle indicates water-wetting preference, while a large angle indicates oil-wetting. Angles near 90 degrees are intermediate-wetting. Different minerals display different wetting preferences, although most are more likely to be water-wet.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/contact_angle
coating flaw,A void in the pipe coating. Coating flaws are detected by either mechanical or visual inspections and must be repaired to avoid significant corrosion problems. A coating flaw is also called a holiday.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/coating_flaw
cold heavy oil production with sand,"A non-thermal primary process for producing heavy oil, also called CHOPS. In this method, continuous production of sand improves the recovery of heavy oil from the reservoir. There is both a theoretical basis and physical evidence that, in many cases, wormholes are formed in the unconsolidated sand reservoir, thereby increasing oil productivity. In most cases, an artificial lift system is used to lift the oil with sand.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cold_heavy_oil_production_with_sand
coke,"An insoluble organic deposit that has low hydrogen content. Coke, also known as pyrobitumen, is formed by thermal cracking and distillation during in-situ combustion.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/coke
condensing drive,"A gasflood process in which an injection gas enriched with components of intermediate molecular weight, for example butane, is injected into a reservoir to achieve multiple-contact miscibility. Upon contact with the oil, intermediate molecular-weight hydrocarbons transfer from the injected gas phase into the oil phase, a process in which those components are said to condense into the oil. Formation of miscibility may require several contacts between fresh enriched gas and the oil containing condensed components. If the reservoir oil becomes sufficiently enriched with these components that miscibility results between the injection gas and the enriched oil, then the enriched gas and oil have multiple-contact miscibility. A backward multiple-contact test is a laboratory evaluation of a condensing drive process. In the field, both forward- and backward-contact processes can occur during a given gasflood.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/condensing_drive
compatibility,"In matrix stimulation, a characteristic of rock that indicates formation permeability is not reduced when treating fluids and their additives contact the formation minerals or fluids inside the reservoir. Compatibility is especially important in sandstone treatments, in which potentially damaging reactions may occur. The treatment fluid should remove existing damage without creating additional damage, such as precipitates or emulsions, through interactions with the formation rock or fluids.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/compatibility
condensate,"A low-density, high-API gravity liquid hydrocarbon phase that generally occurs in association with natural gas. Its presence as a liquid phase depends on temperature and pressure conditions in the reservoir allowing condensation of liquid from vapor. The production of condensate reservoirs can be complicated because of the pressure sensitivity of some condensates: During production, there is a risk of the condensate changing from gas to liquid if the reservoir pressure drops below the dew point during production. Reservoir pressure can be maintained by fluid injection if gas production is preferable to liquid production. Gas produced in association with condensate is called wet gas. The API gravity of condensate is typically 50 degrees to 120 degrees.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/condensate
diffusion,The movement of ions or molecules from regions of high concentration to low concentration within a solution.,Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diffusion
dewpoint,"The pressure at which the first condensate liquid comes out of solution in a gas condensate. Many gas condensate reservoirs are saturated at initial conditions, meaning that the dewpoint is equal to the initial reservoir pressure. Condensate dissolution is called retrograde condensation because this is counter to the behavior of pure substances, which vaporize when the pressure drops below the saturation pressure under isothermal (constant temperature) conditions.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dewpoint
detergency,"The ability of a chemical agent to remove a contaminant from a solid surface. For example, in enhanced oil recovery, a surfactant can be used to remove an oil phase from a mineral surface.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/detergency
dynamic miscibility,"A dynamic fluid-mixing process in which an injected gas exchanges components with in situ oil until the phases achieve a state of miscibility within the mixing zone of the flood front. In a vaporizing drive, light and intermediate components from the oil phase enter the gas phase. By contrast, in a condensing drive, intermediate components from the gas phase enter the oil phase. The process may be a combination of vaporizing and condensing drives.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dynamic_miscibility
disbonding,A common coating problem in which the protective coating detaches from the pipeline.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/disbonding
dry combustion,An in situ combustion technique in which only air or oxygen-enriched air mixtures are injected into a formation. A drawback related to dry combustion is the highly corrosive and noxious combustion products that are produced.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dry_combustion
dry forward combustion,"A type of in situ combustion in which the burning front moves in the same direction as the injected air. As air is continuously supplied at the injection well, the fire ignited at this location moves toward the production wells. During forward combustion, the temperature behind the burning front is high, indicating a great amount of heat stored in the formation matrix. The injected gas heats on contact with the matrix and recovers only a small amount of the heat, with considerable losses to the surrounding formations. Another drawback of dry forward combustion is the presence of a highly viscous oil zone surrounding the production well. The fluid in this zone remains at the original reservoir temperature and its forward displacement by the heated oil is normally difficult.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dry_forward_combustion
displacement front,The interface between an injectant and the fluid it is displacing.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/displacement_front
displacement efficiency,The fraction of oil that has been recovered from a zone swept by a waterflood or other displacement process. Displacement efficiency equation:,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/displacement_efficiency
dispersion,"A type of distortion of a wave train in which the velocity of the wave varies with frequency. Surface waves and electromagnetic body waves typically exhibit dispersion, whereas P-waves in most rocks show little change in velocity with frequency.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dispersion
drainage,"The process of forcing a nonwetting phase into a porous rock. Oil migrates into most reservoirs as the non-wetting phase, so initial charging of the reservoir is a drainage process.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/drainage
recovery factor,"The recoverable amount of hydrocarbon initially in place, normally expressed as a percentage. The recovery factor is a function of the displacement mechanism. An important objective of enhanced oil recovery is to increase the recovery factor.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/recovery_factor
ringworm corrosion,"A type of bimetallic corrosion. Ringworm corrosion has the shape of a ring and is located a few inches from the pipe upset. The ring can either be very smooth or have severe pitting. Ringworm corrosion is caused by the upsetting process, in which the heat required for upsetting creates two different grain structures, one in the upset and another in the rest of the pipe. This condition can be avoided by fully normalizing the pipe after upsetting. To normalize the pipe, heat is applied to change the grains to a uniform structure.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/ringworm_corrosion
rising-bubble apparatus,"A laboratory device used to indicate miscibility between reservoir oil and injection gas. A gas bubble is injected into an oil-filled visual cell at a given temperature and test pressure. The change in shape of the rising bubble indicates its miscibility with the oil at those conditions. Below the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), the bubble holds its shape as it rises. Above the MMP, the bubble shape changes as it rises; it may disintegrate, dissolve or disappear into the oil. Testing at several pressures helps determine the MMP between the gas and oil. The rising-bubble test represents a forward-contacting miscibility process and therefore may not accurately estimate the MMP for a backward or combined contact mechanism.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/rising-bubble_apparatus
reservoir drive mechanisms,"Natural forces in the reservoir that displace hydrocarbons out of the reservoir into the wellbore and up to surface. Reservoir-drive mechanisms include gasdrive (gas cap or solution gasdrive), waterdrive (bottomwater drive or edgewater drive), combination drive, and gravity drainage. Waterdrive is the most efficient drive mechanism, followed by gasdrive and gravity drainage. Reservoir-drive mechanisms are also called natural drives.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reservoir_drive_mechanisms
reservoir heterogeneities,"The variations in rock properties in a reservoir. The variations can result in directional variations in permeability. Geological processes, such as sedimentation, diagenesis and erosion, act to produce nonuniformities in rock formations. Because there are so many types of reservoir heterogeneities, a unique interpretation of test results from pressure data alone is often impossible. Expert test interpreters rely heavily on experience, core analysis, well logs and knowledge of the geology specific to the region.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reservoir_heterogeneities
retort test,"A test for water mud or oil mud, also known as the water, oil and solids test. Proper procedures for retort tests have been published by API. The test is a distillation of a mud sample that measures condensed oil and water collected from the retort. Data obtained are: (1) vol. % water, (2) vol. % oil and (3) vol. % retort solids. Retort solids is the volume that was not recovered as a liquid. Three sizes of retort apparatus are available: 10-, 20- and 50-cm3 mud sample size. Some designs have a small oven in the carrying case to heat the sample (the preferred method for oil muds) while others use a blade heater that goes into the mud sample. Retorts should be heated to around 700°F [371°C] to be effective.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/retort_test
residual oil,"Oil that does not move when fluids are flowed through the rock in normal conditions, for example primary and secondary recovery, and invasion.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/residual_oil
reverse combustion,"A type of in-situ combustion in which the burning front moves in an opposite direction to the injected air. Initially, air is injected into a production well and the fire is ignited. After the burning front has advanced some distance from the production well, air is supplied only near the injection well. The burning front advances toward the injection well while the oil moves toward the production well. Reverse combustion actually refers to dry reverse combustion and can be used to recover extremely viscous oil or tar. In reverse combustion, the liquid blocking problem is solved because a hot zone is maintained near the production well. Despite this advantage, this process is not as efficient as dry forward combustion because lighter fractions of the oil are burned and heavier fractions are left behind the burning front. Another drawback is the possibility of a spontaneous ignition in the injector well, which will divert air for combustion near the injector well instead of near the producer.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reverse_combustion
reducing agent,"A chemical added to an acid to stabilize iron. The injected acid dissolves iron from rust, millscale, iron scales or iron-containing minerals in the formation. Iron can exist as ferric iron [Fe+3] or ferrous iron [Fe+2]. If the iron is not controlled, it will precipitate insoluble products such as ferric hydroxide and, in sour environments, ferrous sulfide [FeS], which will damage the formation. Reducing agents change or reduce Fe+3 to Fe+2 to avoid precipitation. Erythorbic acid is an effective reducing agent.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reducing_agent
lipophilic,Pertaining to an attraction for oil by a surface of a material or a molecule. This term is applied to the oil-wetting behavior of treatment chemicals for oil muds. Lipophilic oil-mud additives are required because most minerals drilled and additives such as barite are naturally hydrophilic and must be rendered lipophilic.,Adjective,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/lipophilic
line drive,"An injection pattern in which the injection wells are located in a straight line parallel to the production wells. In a line drive pattern, the injected fluid, which is normally water, steam or gas, creates a nearly linear frontal movement. A line drive pattern is also called direct line drive.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/line_drive
low-salinity waterflooding,"An enhanced oil recovery method that uses water with a low concentration of dissolved salts as a flooding medium. The sources of low-salinity water are typically rivers, lakes, or aquifers associated with meteoric water.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/low-salinity_waterflooding
liquid blocking,"A phenomenon encountered during dry forward combustion in which an oil zone around the production well cannot be pushed forward by the heated oil. The fluid located in this zone is still at the original reservoir temperature. Therefore, the fluid is still highly viscous and normally not mobile.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/liquid_blocking
injection pattern,"The particular arrangement of production and injection wells. The injection pattern for an individual field or part of a field is based on the location of existing wells, reservoir size and shape, cost of new wells and the recovery increase associated with various injection patterns. The flood pattern can be altered during the life of a field to change the direction of flow in a reservoir with the intent of contacting unswept oil. It is common to reduce the pattern size by infill drilling, which improves oil recovery by increasing reservoir continuity between injectors and producers. Common injection patterns are direct line drive, staggered line drive, two-spot, three-spot, four-spot, five-spot, seven-spot and nine-spot. Normally, the two-spot and three-spot patterns are used for pilot testing purposes. The patterns are called normal or regular when they include only one production well per pattern. Patterns are described as inverted when they include only one injection well per pattern.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/injection_pattern
induced particle plugging,"A type of damage in which foreign particles injected during normal well operations, such as drilling, completion, workover, stimulation or enhanced recovery, block the near-wellbore formation, reducing well productivity. Potentially damaging particles in drilling fluids include clays, cuttings, weighting agents and fluid-loss control materials. In workover and stimulation fluids, suspended solids include bacteria and polymer residues. Foreign plugging particles can also be introduced as a result of poor water-handling practices. These foreign particles include debris from tanks and tubing.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/induced_particle_plugging
immiscible,"Pertaining to a condition in which two fluids are incapable of forming molecularly distributed mixtures or attaining homogeneity at that scale. The fluids separate into two phases with an interface between them. For example, oil and water are immiscible.",Adjective,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/immiscible
imbibition,"The process of absorbing a wetting phase into a porous rock. Imbibition is important in a waterdrive reservoir because it can advance or hinder water movement, affecting areal sweep. Spontaneous imbibition refers to the process of absorption with no pressure driving the phase into the rock. It is possible for the same rock to imbibe both water and oil, with water imbibing at low in situ water saturation, displacing excess oil from the surface of the rock grains, and oil imbibing at low in-situ oil saturation, displacing excess water. An imbibition test is a comparison of the imbibition potential of water and oil into a rock. The wettability of the rock is determined by which phase imbibes more.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/imbibition
infill drilling,"The addition of wells in a field that decreases average well spacing. This practice both accelerates expected recovery and increases estimated ultimate recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs by improving the continuity between injectors and producers. As well spacing is decreased, the shifting well patterns alter the formation-fluid flow paths and increase sweep to areas where greater hydrocarbon saturations exist.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/infill_drilling
impressed current anodes,Materials to provide cathodic protection. Impressed current anodes are relatively inert to corrosion and require an external power source to generate the electric current that will bring cathodic protection to the structure. Impressed current systems are used mainly when the current required for cathodic protection is large.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/impressed_current_anodes
in-situ combustion,"A method of thermal recovery in which fire is generated inside the reservoir by injecting a gas containing oxygen, such as air. A special heater in the well ignites the oil in the reservoir and starts a fire. The heat generated by burning the heavy hydrocarbons in place produces hydrocarbon cracking, vaporization of light hydrocarbons and reservoir water in addition to the deposition of heavier hydrocarbons known as coke. As the fire moves, the burning front pushes ahead a mixture of hot combustion gases, steam and hot water, which in turn reduces oil viscosity and displaces oil toward production wells. Additionally, the light hydrocarbons and the steam move ahead of the burning front, condensing into liquids, which adds the advantages of miscible displacement and hot waterflooding. In situ combustion is also known as fire flooding or fireflood.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/in-situ_combustion
improved oil recovery,"A method for recovering additional oil beyond fluid expansion, rock compressibility, gravitational drainage, pressure decline and natural waterdrive or gasdrive. This term is used in both a restricted sense and a more general sense. In its restricted sense, it is a process, such as waterflooding or gasflooding, that adds energy to a reservoir to stimulate oil production and increase recovery factor. In its more general sense, it is any activity that increases oil production and increases the recovery factor. This sense can also include, for example, enhanced oil recovery methods, infill drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and drilling horizontal and multilateral wells.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/improved_oil_recovery
iron-oxidizing bacteria,"Aerobic bacteria that convert iron from the ferrous [Fe+2] to the ferric [Fe+3] state and produce ferric hydroxide [Fe(OH)3], which is a highly insoluble by-product that will damage the formation. Iron-oxidizing bacteria also produce some corrosion, but they are considered harmful mainly because they cover sulfate-reducing bacteria colonies and protect them from attack with bactericides.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/iron-oxidizing_bacteria
in situ combustion,"A method of thermal recovery in which fire is generated inside the reservoir by injecting a gas containing oxygen, such as air.

inverted five-spot,An injection pattern in which four production wells are located at the corners of a square and the injector well sits in the center.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/inverted_five-spot
interfacial tension,"A property of the interface between two immiscible phases. When the phases are both liquid, it is termed interfacial tension; when one of the phases is air, it is termed surface tension. Interfacial tension is the Gibbs free energy per unit area of interface at fixed temperature and pressure. Interfacial tension occurs because a molecule near an interface has different molecular interactions than an equivalent molecule within the bulk fluid. Surfactant molecules preferentially position themselves at the interface and thereby lower the interfacial tension.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/interfacial_tension
interwell tomography,"A technique for measuring a signal that is broadcast from a transmitter or source located in one well, to a receiver array placed in a neighboring well. This technique is used to create a display of formation properties such as acoustic velocity and attenuation, seismic reflectivity, or electromagnetic resistivity in the area between wells. The reservoir-scale data acquired with this technique can be used to bridge the gap between wellbore measurements and surface measurements.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/interwell_tomography
nitrogen injection,"A process whereby nitrogen gas is injected into an oil reservoir to increase the oil recovery factor. Below the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), this is an immiscible process in which recovery is increased by oil swelling, viscosity reduction and limited crude-oil vaporization. Above the MMP, nitrogen injection is a miscible vaporizing drive. Miscibility of nitrogen can be achieved only with light oils that are at high pressures; therefore, the miscible method is suitable only in deep reservoirs.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/nitrogen_injection
Young-Laplace equation,"A relationship describing the pressure difference across an interface between two fluids at a static, curved interface. This relationship defines the capillary pressure difference at such an interface.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/y/young-laplace_equation
organic acid,"A type of organic fluid, such as acetic or formic acid, used in oil and gas well-stimulation treatments. The use of inhibited HCl at elevated temperatures is limited to relatively short exposure times because of the risk of increased corrosion. Inhibited organic acids are much less reactive with metals than are HCl or mixtures of HCl and HF. For this reason, organic acids are commonly used successfully at high bottomhole temperatures or when long contact times between acid and pipe are needed, such as during perforating. Organic acids also are used to protect exotic alloys, such as aluminum or chrome-plated parts.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/organic_acid
organic deposit,"A type of damage in which heavy hydrocarbons precipitate when temperature or pressure is reduced. These deposits are commonly located in the tubing, gravel pack and perforations, or inside the formation. The injection of cold treating fluids promotes the formation of organic deposits. Organic deposits such as paraffins or asphaltenes are resolubilized using aromatic organic solvents such as toluene or xylene. Small amounts of alcohol help to further dissolve asphaltenes.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/organic_deposit
oil-wet,"Pertaining to the preference of a solid to be in contact with an oil phase rather than a water or gas phase. Oil-wet rocks preferentially imbibe oil. Generally, polar compounds or asphaltenes deposited from the crude oil onto mineral surfaces cause the oil-wet condition. Similar compounds in oil-base mud also can cause a previously water-wet rock to become partially or totally oil-wet.",Adjective,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oil-wet
off-pattern well,A production or injection well that has a lateral or diagonal displacement with respect to the other wells in an injection pattern. The existence of an off-pattern well affects oil recovery and water/oil ratio.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/off-pattern_well
oil mining,"A strip-mining process involving the removal and subsequent processing of tar sand from shallow reservoirs containing heavy, viscous oil. The oil is mostly bitumen and does not flow at reservoir conditions. For strip mining to be economic, the reservoir must be shallow and have high oil saturation. Strip mining is energy intensive, both in mining the tar sand and in its subsequent processing. Large amounts of waste material, called gangue, are produced. Companies are usually required to landscape the area when mining is completed.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oil_mining
oil swelling,"An expansion in oil volume that can occur when a solvent contacts a reservoir fluid. The swelling is due to the complete or partial dissolution of the solvent molecules into the reservoir fluid. The amount of swelling is dependent on the pressure, temperature, composition and physical properties of the solvent and the reservoir fluid. Reservoir oil swelling can result in improved oil recovery by mobilizing residual oil trapped in inaccessible pore spaces.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oil_swelling
oil bank,The portion of a reservoir where the oil saturation is increased because of the application of an improved oil recovery method.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oil_bank
pitting,A type of corrosion in which there is loss of metal in localized areas. The corrosion rate in the pits is many times greater than the corrosion rate on the entire surface. The resultant pits can be large and shallow or narrow and deep. Pitting is a more dangerous problem than general corrosion because the pitted areas can be easily penetrated.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pitting
paraffin control,A set of techniques used to prevent or considerably reduce paraffin deposition. Paraffin control might involve the following options:,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/paraffin_control
paraffin inhibitor,"A chemical injected into the wellbore to prevent or minimize paraffin deposition. The effectiveness of paraffin inhibitors is strongly dependent on crude oil composition. Paraffin inhibitors must be introduced into the oil before the oil cools to its cloud point. In additional, asphaltene composition should be determined before treatment because it can reduce the effectiveness of the paraffin inhibitor. In some cases, the use of a paraffin inhibitor can actually increase the rate of paraffin deposition because the stability of colloidal asphaltenes is disturbed.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/paraffin_inhibitor
partitioning,"The degree of solubilization of a solute into each of multiple immiscible phases at equilibrium. For example, a water-soluble surfactant injected as part of an enhanced oil recovery flood will partially solubilize, or partition, in the oil phase. The degree of partitioning will influence the efficiency of the enhanced oil recovery agent.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/partitioning
pendant-drop tensiometer,"A standard laboratory instrument used to measure interfacial tension. The method is particularly applicable to relatively high interfacial tensions, but with care can measure down to approximately 1 mN/m. A drop of the denser liquid is poised at the end of a square-ended syringe needle. The drop is of sufficient size that its shape is deformed by gravity, but not so large that it detaches from the syringe. Its shape is determined by the balance of interfacial tension and gravity. The interfacial tension can be obtained from the drop shape and the densities of the two liquids. The method works equally well for a drop of the less-dense liquid by inverting the syringe. This inverted configuration can be useful if the less-dense liquid is opaque.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pendant-drop_tensiometer
primary production,"Also known as primary recovery, the first stage of hydrocarbon production, in which natural reservoir energy, such as gasdrive, waterdrive or gravity drainage, displaces hydrocarbons from the reservoir, into the wellbore and up to surface. Initially, the reservoir pressure is considerably higher than the bottomhole pressure inside the wellbore. This high natural differential pressure drives hydrocarbons toward the well and up to surface. However, as the reservoir pressure declines because of production, so does the differential pressure. To reduce the bottomhole pressure or increase the differential pressure to increase hydrocarbon production, it is necessary to implement an artificial lift system, such as a rod pump, an electrical submersible pump or a gas-lift installation. Production using artificial lift is considered primary recovery. The primary recovery stage reaches its limit either when the reservoir pressure is so low that the production rates are not economical, or when the proportions of gas or water in the production stream are too high. During primary recovery, only a small percentage of the initial hydrocarbons in place are produced, typically around 10% for oil reservoirs.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/primary_production

PVT,"An abbreviation for pressure, volume, temperature. The term is used in fluid properties evaluations.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pvt
polymer flooding,"An enhanced oil recovery technique using water viscosified with soluble polymers. Viscosity is increased until the mobility of the injectant is less than that of the oil phase in place, so the mobility ratio is less than unity. This condition maximizes oil-recovery sweep efficiency, creating a smooth flood front without viscous fingering. Polymer flooding is also applied to heterogeneous reservoirs; the viscous injectant flows along high-permeability layers, decreasing the flow rates within them and enhancing sweep of zones with lower permeabilities. The two polymers that are used most frequently in polymer flooding are partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide and xanthan.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/polymer_flooding
polysaccharide,"A carbohydrate composed of many monosaccharides. Polysaccharides increase the viscosity of the water slug that precedes the final water injection. However, they are not frequently used in chemical flooding operations because they generate numerous by-products that can potentially plug filters or well sandfaces, especially when they contact polyvalent cations or bacteria. Polysaccharides are also called biopolymers.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/polysaccharide
polyacrylamide,"A polymer with a high molecular weight. The basic repeating unit or monomer of polyacrylamide is a combination of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.

pressure-composition diagram,"A graphical representation indicating phase behavior for variation of saturation pressure and injection gas concentration at a given temperature. The diagram indicates conditions for single-phase and two-phase behavior and, within the two-phase region, lines of constant volume fraction, termed quality lines. The diagram is constructed using swelling test saturation pressures and liquid volumes.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure-composition_diagram
preflush,"A fluid stage, normally hydrochloric acid [HCl], pumped ahead of the main treating fluid (mixture of hydrofluoric [HF] and hydrochloric [HCl] or organic acids) in a sandstone matrix-stimulation treatment. One of the purposes of a preflush is to displace formation brines that contain K, Na, Ca ions away from the wellbore, decreasing the possibility of crystallizing alkali-fluosilicates that could plug the pores. The other purpose of a preflush is to dissolve calcareous materials to minimize calcium fluoride [CaF2] precipitation, and to dissolve iron scale or rust to avoid the precipitation of the gelatinous, highly insoluble ferric hydroxide [Fe(OH)3]. Multiple preflush stages using brines such as ammonium chloride [NH4Cl] or solvents are used when multiple damage types are present. A preflush is sometimes called a spearhead.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/preflush
precipitate,"To form an insoluble material in a fluid. Precipitation can occur by a chemical reaction of two or more ions in solution or by changing the temperature of a saturated solution. There are many examples of this important phenomenon in drilling fluids. Precipitation occurs in the reaction between calcium cations and carbonate anions to form insoluble calcium carbonate: Ca+2 + CO3-2 --> CaCO3. When a saturated clear brine first crystallizes, the solid is a precipitate, and is often caused by changing temperature.",Verb,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/precipitate
ultralow interfacial tension,"Values of interfacial tension (IFT) less than about 10–2 mN/m.

Ultralow IFT implies",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/ultralow_interfacial_tension
vapor extraction (vapex),"A non-thermal heavy oil production method. Similar in concept to SAGD, in vapor extraction a solvent vapor is used to reduce viscosity of the heavy oil. The injected solvent vapor expands and dilutes the heavy oil by contact. The diluted heavy oil will drain by gravity to the lower horizontal well, to be produced.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/vapor_extraction
vaporizing drive,"A gasflood process in which a lean gas, for example methane, nitrogen or carbon dioxide, is injected into a reservoir to achieve multiple-contact miscibility. Upon contact with the oil, light and intermediate molecular-weight hydrocarbons transfer from the oil into the gas phase, thus vaporizing into the gas. Formation of miscibility may require several contacts between gas containing vaporized components and fresh reservoir oil. If the injected gas becomes sufficiently enriched with these components that miscibility results with the oil, then the lean gas and oil have multiple-contact miscibility. A forward multiple-contact test is a laboratory evaluation of a vaporizing drive process. In the field, both forward- and backward-contact processes can occur during a given gasflood.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/vaporizing_drive
vertical displacement efficiency,"In a displacement process, the ratio of the cumulative height of the vertical sections of the pay zone that are contacted by injection fluid to the total vertical pay zone height. Vertical displacement efficiency (EI) strongly depends on parameters such as mobility ratio and total volume of fluid injected. Nonuniform permeability may cause an irregular front that affects the vertical displacement efficiency because the injected fluid flows faster in high-permeability zones than in low-permeability zones.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/vertical_displacement_efficiency
viscous oil,"Crude oil with high viscosity (typically above 10 cP), and high specific gravity. The API classifies heavy oil as crudes with a gravity below 22.3° API. In addition to high viscosity and high specific gravity, heavy oils typically have low hydrogen-to-carbon ratios; high asphaltene, sulfur, nitrogen, and heavy-metal content; and higher acid numbers.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/viscous_oil
viscous fingering,"A condition whereby the interface of two fluids, such as oil and water, bypasses sections of reservoir as it moves along, creating an uneven, or fingered, profile. Fingering is a relatively common condition in reservoirs with water-injection wells. The result of fingering is an inefficient sweeping action that can bypass significant volumes of recoverable oil and, in severe cases, an early breakthrough of water into adjacent production wellbores.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/viscous_fingering
volumetric displacement efficiency,"Another term for volumetric sweep efficiency, a measure of the effectiveness of an enhanced oil recovery process that depends on the volume of the reservoir contacted by the injected fluid.

viscous force,"A measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. Viscous forces in a fluid are proportional to the rate at which the fluid velocity is changing in space; the proportionality constant is the viscosity. For Newtonian liquids (liquids that show no variation of viscosity with shear or extension rate), the ratio of extensional viscosity to shear viscosity is 3. This value is Trouton's ratio. For more complex liquids, for example, polymer solutions, Trouton's ratio can be different from 3 and can vary with shear or extension rate.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/viscous_force
vertical sweep efficiency,"Another term for vertical displacement efficiency, in a displacement process, the ratio of the cumulative height of the vertical sections of the pay zone that are contacted by injection fluid to the total vertical pay zone height.

This process is used mostly in CO2 floods to improve hydrocarbon contact time and sweep efficiency of the CO2.,Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/water_alternating_gas
wormhole,"A large, empty channel that can penetrate several feet into the formation, caused by the nonuniform dissolution of limestone or dolomite by hydrochloric acid [HCl]. Wormholes are created during matrix stimulation or acid fracturing of carbonate formations. The purpose of matrix stimulation is to create highly conductive wormholes to bypass damage. However, in fracture acidizing, wormholing is a problem, since it is an unwanted diversion of the live acid from the hydraulic fracture system, which causes a reduction of the etched fracture length.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wormhole
waterflooding,"A method of secondary recovery in which water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil. The water from injection wells physically sweeps the displaced oil to adjacent production wells. Potential problems associated with waterflood techniques include inefficient recovery due to variable permeability, or similar conditions affecting fluid transport within the reservoir, and early water breakthrough that may cause production and surface processing problems.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/waterflooding

Winsor phase behavior,"A distinction among three phase behaviors of oil, water and surfactant systems when they form a microemulsion. The salinity of the brine phase is an important parameter influencing which type of behavior occurs. To test for the type of system, surfactant is added to an oil-water system. In a Winsor Type I system, the surfactant forms an oil-in-water microemulsion in the aqueous phase. This behavior is not favorable to achieve ultralow interfacial tension with surfactants. In a Winsor Type II system, the surfactant forms a water-in-oil emulsion in the oil phase. This behavior leads to surfactant retention in the oil phase and is unfavorable for an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process. In a Winsor Type III system, the surfactant forms a microemulsion in a separate phase between the oil and aqueous phases. This phase is a continuous layer containing surfactant, water and dissolved hydrocarbons. This situation is ideal to achieve ultralow interfacial tension values and is favorable for EOR.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/winsor_phase_behavior
wet combustion,"An in situ combustion technique in which water is injected simultaneously or alternately with air into a formation. Wet combustion actually refers to wet forward combustion and was developed to use the great amount of heat that would otherwise be lost in the formation. The injected water recovers the heat from behind the burning front and transfers it to the oil bank ahead. Because of this additional energy, the oil displacement is more efficient and requires less air. In spite of these advantages, a wet combustion process cannot avoid liquid-blocking problems and use of wet combustion is limited by the oil viscosity. Wet combustion is also called in situ steam generation or a combination of forward combustion and waterflooding, which is abbreviated as COFCAW.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wet_combustion
wettability change,"A type of damage in which the formation wettability is modified, generating a change in relative permeability that eventually affects well productivity. Surfactants or other additives in drilling fluids, especially oil-base mud, or other injected fluids can change formation wettability. A naturally water-wet formation could be changed into an oil-wet formation with consequent production impairment caused by reduction of oil relative permeability. Wettability change is normally treated with mutual solvents to remove the rock-oil coating (asphaltene or paraffin precipitation), followed by a strong water-wet surfactant to reduce the tendency of further hydrocarbon precipitation.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wettability_change
wettability,"The preference of a solid to contact one liquid or gas, known as the wetting phase, rather than another. The wetting phase will tend to spread on the solid surface and a porous solid will tend to imbibe the wetting phase, in both cases displacing the nonwetting phase. Rocks can be water-wet, oil-wet or intermediate-wet. The intermediate state between water-wet and oil-wet can be caused by a mixed-wet system, in which some surfaces or grains are water-wet and others are oil-wet, or a neutral-wet system, in which the surfaces are not strongly wet by either water or oil. Both water and oil wet most materials in preference to gas, but gas can wet sulfur, graphite and coal. Wettability affects relative permeability, electrical properties, nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation times and saturation profiles in the reservoir. The wetting state impacts waterflooding and aquifer encroachment into a reservoir. Reservoir wetting preference can be determined by measuring the contact angle of crude oil and formation water on silica or calcite crystals or by measuring the characteristics of core plugs in either an Amott imbibition test or a USBM test.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wettability
well stimulation,"A treatment performed to restore or enhance the productivity of a well. Stimulation treatments fall into two main groups, hydraulic fracturing treatments and matrix treatments. Fracturing treatments are performed above the fracture pressure of the reservoir formation and create a highly conductive flow path between the reservoir and the wellbore. Matrix treatments are performed below the reservoir fracture pressure and generally are designed to restore the natural permeability of the reservoir following damage to the near-wellbore area. Stimulation in shale gas reservoirs typically takes the form of hydraulic fracturing treatments.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_stimulation
API gravity,"A specific gravity scale developed by the American Petroleum Institute (API) for measuring the relative density of various petroleum liquids, expressed in degrees. API gravity is gradated in degrees on a hydrometer instrument and was designed so that most values would fall between 10° and 70° API gravity. The arbitrary formula used to obtain this effect is: API gravity = (141.5/SG at 60 degF) – 131.5, where SG is the specific gravity of the fluid.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/api_gravity
ASP flooding,"A chemical enhanced oil recovery flood that uses two sources of surfactant and a polymer.

The precipitation is typically measured at specific conditions of temperature and pressure, such as at reservoir or flowline conditions.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/asphaltene_precipitation
asphaltenes,"Organic materials consisting of aromatic and naphthenic ring compounds containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen molecules. The asphaltene fraction of crude is defined as the organic part of the oil that is not soluble in straight-chain solvents such as pentane or heptane. Asphaltenes exist as a colloidal suspension stabilized by resin molecules (aromatic ring systems) in the oil. The stability of asphaltic dispersions depends on the ratio of resin to asphaltene molecules. The determination of the quantity of resin is important in estimating the potential damage created by asphaltenes. Asphaltene precipitates as a result of pressure drop, shear (turbulent flow), acids, solution carbon dioxide (CO2), injected condensate, mixing of incompatible crude oils or other conditions or materials that break the stability of the asphaltic dispersion. For example, in matrix acidizing, iron ions in solution favor the precipitation of asphaltene deposits.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/asphaltenes
adsorption,"The property of some solids and liquids to attract a liquid or a gas to their surfaces. Some solids, such as activated charcoal or silica gel, are used as surfaces of adhesion to gather liquid hydrocarbons from a natural gas stream. To complete the process, the solids are treated with steam to recover the liquid hydrocarbons.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/adsorption
adhesion tension,"In a system with two immiscible fluids in contact with a solid, the difference in the two fluid-solid surface tensions. In thermodynamic equilibrium this difference is equivalent as a result of the Young-Laplace equation to the product of the interfacial tension between the two fluids and the cosine of the contact angle at the fluid/fluid/solid interface. As the combination of these two individual interfacial terms, adhesion tension is a useful measure of the wetting character of a petroleum reservoir's pore system.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/adhesion_tension
alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding,"A chemical enhanced oil recovery flood that uses two sources of surfactant and a polymer.

alkaline flooding,"An enhanced oil recovery technique in which an alkaline chemical such as sodium hydroxide, sodium orthosilicate or sodium carbonate is injected during polymer flooding or waterflooding operations. The alkaline chemical reacts with certain types of oils, forming surfactants inside the reservoir. Eventually, the surfactants reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water and trigger an increase in oil production. Alkaline flooding is not recommended for carbonate reservoirs because of the abundance of calcium: the mixture between the alkaline chemical and the calcium ions can produce hydroxide precipitation that may damage the formation. Alkaline flooding is also known as caustic flooding.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/alkaline_flooding
acid number,A measure of the amount of acidic components present in a crude oil.

secondary recovery,"The second stage of hydrocarbon production during which an external fluid such as water or gas is injected into the reservoir through injection wells located in rock that has fluid communication with production wells. The purpose of secondary recovery is to maintain reservoir pressure and to displace hydrocarbons toward the wellbore. The most common secondary recovery techniques are gas injection and waterflooding. Normally, gas is injected into the gas cap and water is injected into the production zone to sweep oil from the reservoir. A pressure-maintenance program can begin during the primary recovery stage, but it is a form or enhanced recovery. The secondary recovery stage reaches its limit when the injected fluid (water or gas) is produced in considerable amounts from the production wells and the production is no longer economical. The successive use of primary recovery and secondary recovery in an oil reservoir produces about 15% to 40% of the original oil in place.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/secondary_recovery
stimulation,"A treatment performed to restore or enhance the productivity of a well. Stimulation treatments fall into two main groups, hydraulic fracturing treatments and matrix treatments.

Hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) number helps define the function that a molecular group will perform.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/surfactant
surfactant-alternating gas,"An enhanced oil recovery process in which alternating slugs of a surfactant solution and gas are injected into a reservoir. The injected surfactant and gas mix and generate foam that reduces the gas mobility, especially in previously swept or high-permeability regions of the reservoir. This improves sweep efficiency by mitigating gravity override and viscous fingering during gas injection. The presence of the surfactant in the injectant can also improve recovery by reducing interfacial tension between reservoir oil and the injection phases.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/surfactant-alternating_gas
steam trap,A barrier or resistance to the flow of injected steam formed by a volume around a producing well in a steamflood that contains high oil and liquid water saturation.

Solvent injection is performed at several test pressures. Effluent production, density and composition are measured as functions of the injected volume. Oil recovery after injection of a specific number of pore volumes (PV) such as 1.2 PV of solvent is the test criterion for miscibility. Two trend lines appear on a plot of recovery versus pore pressure for several slim-tube tests. The point of intersection of those trend lines is the estimated MMP for the given oil-solvent system. The data from a slim tube test can also be used as input to fine-tune a fluid equation of state for reservoir simulation.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/slim-tube_test

Chemical removal is performed with different solvents according to the type of scale: · Carbonate scales such as calcium carbonate or calcite [CaCO3] can be readily dissolved with hydrochloric acid [HCl] at temperatures less than 250oF [121oC]. · Sulfate scales such as gypsum [CaSO4·2H2O] or anhydrite [CaSO4] can be readily dissolved using ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). The dissolution of barytine [BaSO4] or strontianite [SrSO4] is much more difficult. · Chloride scales such as sodium chloride [NaCl] are easily dissolved with fresh water or weak acidic solutions, including HCl or acetic acid. · Iron scales such as iron sulfide [FeS] or iron oxide [Fe2O3] can be dissolved using HCl with sequestering or reducing agents to avoid precipitation of by-products, for example iron hydroxides and elemental sulfur. · Silica scales such as crystallized deposits of chalcedony or amorphous opal normally associated with steamflood projects can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid [HF].",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/scale_removal

sandstone petrography,"The study of and description of sandstones, including the mineral content. In matrix stimulation, only the mineral surfaces contacted by the stimulation fluid will be dissolved, so a petrographic study often helps anticipate the rocks response to fluid injection. Sandstone reservoirs are made of silicate grains such as quartz, feldspar, chert and mica, which are deposited as sand; secondary minerals may be deposited in the original pore spaces. Secondary quartz or carbonate minerals often bind sand grains together. Authigenic clays, mainly composed of silicon and aluminum, may also form in the pores. The reactivity of a given mineral depends on three factors: surface area, chemical composition and temperature. Clays have greater specific surface area compared with other matrix minerals, which makes them the most reactive components during well-stimulation operations.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sandstone_petrography

sequestering agent,"A chemical whose molecular structure can envelop and hold a certain type of ion in a stable and soluble complex. Divalent cations, such as hardness ions, form stable and soluble complex structures with several types of sequestering chemicals. When held inside the complex, the ions have a limited ability to react with other ions, clays or polymers. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a well-known sequestering agent for the hardness ions, such as Ca+2, and is the reagent solution used in the hardness test protocol published by API. Polyphosphates can also sequester hardness ions. The addition of sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) to a cement-contaminated mud renders the calcium ions essentially nonreactive with clays in the mud. As a side benefit, SAPP also lowers mud pH. Sequestering is not the same as precipitation because sequestering does not form a solid.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sequestering_agent

solubility,"The maximum amount of a substance that will dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature and pressure, or the degree to which a substance will dissolve in a particular solvent. The solubility of a substance is its concentration in a saturated solution. Two fluids that are soluble in one another in all proportions are also referred to as miscible.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/solubility
spinning-drop tensiometer,"A standard laboratory instrument to measure interfacial tension. The method is particularly applicable to values of interfacial tension below 1 mN/m and especially below 10-2 mN/m, as may occur when employing surfactants for enhanced oil recovery. The method utilizes a tube containing a drop of the less-dense phase within the more-dense phase. When the tube is spun along its long axis at high speed, the resulting forces center the drop on the tube axis and deform it. The interfacial tension is a function of the shape of the deformed drop, the liquid densities and the rotation speed. Advanced versions of the instrument can periodically vary the rotation rate. The phase lag between the change of rotation rate and the drop deformation can be used to determine both interfacial elasticity and interfacial viscosity.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spinning-drop_tensiometer
steam chamber,"The volume of reservoir in which mobile steam exists for an extended period of time. Within the steam chamber, rock temperature rises to the point where steam vapor can be sustained at reservoir pressure conditions. The steam chamber is normally found in the upper portion of a reservoir sand between a steam injector and a producer, where steam has broken through to the producer. With time, the steam chamber can expand to cover an entire area of a five-spot pattern steamflood. For a steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) system, the steam chamber in a mature field project can extend from a broad area across the top of the sand to a narrow finger down to the producing horizontal well near the bottom of the sand. Also referred to as a steam chest.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/steam_chamber
steamflood,"A method of thermal recovery in which steam generated at surface is injected into the reservoir through specially distributed injection wells. When steam enters the reservoir, it heats up the crude oil and reduces its viscosity. The heat also distills light components of the crude oil, which condense in the oil bank ahead of the steam front, further reducing the oil viscosity. The hot water that condenses from the steam and the steam itself generate an artificial drive that sweeps oil toward producing wells. Another contributing factor that enhances oil production during steam injection is related to near-wellbore cleanup. In this case, steam reduces the interfacial tension that ties paraffins and asphaltenes to the rock surfaces while steam distillation of crude oil light ends creates a small solvent bank that can miscibly remove trapped oil. Steamflooding is also called continuous steam injection or steam drive.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/steamflood
steam-assisted gravity drainage,"A thermal production method for heavy oil that pairs a high-angle injection well with a nearby production well drilled along a parallel trajectory. The pair of high-angle wells is drilled with a vertical separation of about 5 m [16 ft]. Steam is injected into the reservoir through the upper well. As the steam rises and expands, it heats up the heavy oil, reducing its viscosity. Gravity forces the oil to drain into the lower well where it is produced.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/steam-assisted_gravity_drainage
standard batch,"A type of batch-treating technique used in corrosion control. The batch of corrosion inhibitor is displaced through the annulus to the bottom of the well. Once the inhibitor is at the bottom, it is circulated up the tubing and returned back into the annulus, leaving a considerable amount of inhibitor in the annulus for further circulation. A standard batch treatment is used mainly in pumping wells and could last from a day to several months depending on the specific corrosion inhibitor used.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/standard_batch
steam-oil ratio,"Parameter used to monitor the efficiency of oil production processes based on steam injection. Commonly abbreviated as SOR, it measures the volume of steam required to produce one unit volume of oil. Typical values of SOR for cyclic steam stimulation are in the range of three to eight, while typical SOR values for steam assisted gravity drainage are in the range of two to five. The lower the SOR, the more efficiently the steam is utilized and the lower the associated fuel costs.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/steam-oil_ratio
steam,"A two-phase mixture of liquid water and steam produced from a generator. The latent heat of vaporization for steam is very high, and when the steam condenses in the reservoir a significant amount of heat is transferred from the steam to the formation rock and fluids. Since steam is lighter and more mobile than oil, gravity differences and channeling of the steam through the most permeable parts of the reservoir can create sweep efficiency problems during steam-injection processes. To increase sweep efficiency, there are two categories of improvements. The first is operational changes such as selective completion of injector wells, fracturing operations and constructing horizontal wells, and the second is the use of additives in the steam. For example, water-soluble surfactants modify interfacial properties of the oil-water system, and foams reduce steam mobility.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/steam
damage,"Natural or induced production impairments that can develop in the reservoir, the near-wellbore area, the perforations, the gravel-pack completion or the production pipelines, such as the tubing. Natural damage occurs as produced reservoir fluids move through the reservoir, while induced damage is the result of external operations and fluids in the well, such as drilling, well completion, workover operations or stimulation treatments. Some induced damage triggers natural damage mechanisms. Natural damage includes phenomena such as fines migration, clay swelling, scale formation, organic deposition, including paraffins or asphaltenes, and mixed organic and inorganic deposition. Induced damage includes plugging caused by foreign particles in the injected fluid, wettability changes, emulsions, precipitates or sludges caused by acid reactions, bacterial activity and water blocks. Wellbore cleanup or matrix stimulation treatments are two different operations that can remove natural or induced damage. Selecting the proper operation depends on the location and nature of the damage.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/damage
toe to heel air injection,"An in-situ combustion method for producing heavy oil. In this technique, the fireflooding starts from a vertical well, while the oil is produced from a horizontal well having its toe in close proximity to the vertical air-injection well. This production method is a modification of conventional fire flooding techniques in which the flame front from a vertical well pushes the oil to be produced from another vertical well.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/toe_to_heel_air_injection
trapped oil,"Oil in pore spaces that cannot be moved because of capillary forces. Typical trapped or residual oil saturation is in the range of 10% to 50% of the pore space, and it is higher in tighter formations where the pore spaces are small. The amount of trapped oil is a function of the displacement method and conditions, making this oil a target for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. EOR methods introduce fluids that reduce viscosity, interfacial tension or mobility ratio, and thus improve flow and sweep efficiency to release the residual oil.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/trapped_oil
tertiary recovery,"Traditionally, the third stage of hydrocarbon production, comprising recovery methods that follow waterflooding or pressure maintenance. The principal tertiary recovery techniques used are thermal methods, gas injection and chemical flooding. The term is sometimes used as a synonym for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), but because EOR methods today may be applied at any stage of reservoir development, the term tertiary recovery is less commonly used than in the past.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tertiary_recovery
ternary diagram,"A graphical representation of concentrations in a system with three components. Since the sum of the component percentages is unity, any composition can be uniquely mapped to a single point within a triangular space. In many cases, a mixture of fluids with more than three components is divided into three pseudocomponents, such as light, intermediate and heavy components of a hydrocarbon phase. These diagrams are used to illustrate the phase behavior of a fluid.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/ternary_diagram
TEOR,"Abbreviation for thermal enhanced oil recovery, also known as thermal recovery, a general term for injection processes that introduce heat into a reservoir. Thermal recovery is used to produce viscous, thick oils with API gravities less than 20. These oils cannot flow unless they are heated and their viscosity is reduced enough to allow flow toward producing wells. During thermal recovery, crude oil undergoes physical and chemical changes because of the effects of the heat supplied. Physical properties such as viscosity, specific gravity and interfacial tension are altered. The chemical changes involve different reactions such as cracking, which is the destruction of carbon-carbon bonds to generate lower molecular weight compounds, and dehydrogenation, which is the rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Thermal recovery is a major branch of enhanced oil recovery processes and can be subdivided in two types: hot fluid injection such as steam injection (steamflood or cyclic steam injection) and hot waterflooding and in-situ combustion processes.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/teor
tubing displacement,"A type of batch-treating technique used in corrosion control in which a batch of corrosion inhibitor is displaced through the tubing to the bottom of the well. The well is shut in for 2 to 15 hr and then put back on production. The tubing-displacement technique, also called a kiss squeeze, is used mainly in wells with packers and in gas-lift wells. The treatment could last from a week to several months depending on the specific corrosion inhibitor used.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tubing_displacement
thermal simulation,"The finite-difference or finite-element reservoir simulation that includes energy equations and calculations used to describe heat conduction, heat and fluid convection, and latent heat exchanges occurring in the reservoir rock and fluids during a thermal recovery process such as steamflooding, steam assisted gravity drainage, or in-situ combustion. Combustion thermal simulation also requires equations for modeling combustion reaction kinetics.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thermal_simulation

microemulsion,"A thermodynamically stable emulsion consisting of a mixture of oil, water and surfactant. In contrast to a simple emulsion formed under shear, a microemulsion is a minimum energy state. It does not require an input of energy into the system to form; instead, it forms spontaneously. Depending on the structure of the surfactant and the presence or absence of cosurfactant, an oil-in-water system (Winsor Type I), a water-in-oil system (Winsor Type II) or a bicontinuous system (Winsor Type III) may form. Various structures of micelles and reverse micelles are possible, ranging from spherical through cylindrical to lamellar. A typical microemulsion will have micelle diameters in the range of 3 to 20 nm.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/microemulsion

mobility buffer,"In chemical flooding, a fluid stage, normally water thickened with a polymer, pumped between the micellar or alkaline chemical solution and the final water injection. Mobility buffers are prepared with polyacrylamides or polysaccharides and are frequently employed in micellar-polymer flooding operations because they improve sweep efficiency, which increases oil production. The high viscosity of the mobility buffer aids in the displacement of chemicals into the reservoir and also minimizes the channeling of the final water injection into the chemical solution or into the resulting oil bank.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mobility_buffer
multiple-contact miscibility,"A dynamic fluid-mixing process in which an injected gas exchanges components with in situ oil until the phases achieve a state of miscibility within the mixing zone of the flood front. In a vaporizing drive, light and intermediate components from the oil phase enter the gas phase. By contrast, in a condensing drive, intermediate components from the gas phase enter the oil phase. The process may be a combination of vaporizing and condensing drives.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiple-contact_miscibility
mobility control,"A condition in oil recovery processes whereby the mobility of the injectant is lower than that of the oil or preceding chemical slug, leading to a stable displacement by the injectant.

miscible displacement,"A general term for injection processes that introduce miscible gases into the reservoir. A miscible displacement process maintains reservoir pressure and improves oil displacement because the interfacial tension between oil and water is reduced. The effect of gas injection is similar to that of a solution gasdrive. Miscible displacement is a major branch of enhanced oil recovery processes. Injected gases include liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), such as propane, methane under high pressure, methane enriched with light hydrocarbons, nitrogen under high pressure, and carbon dioxide [CO2] under suitable reservoir conditions of temperature and pressure. The fluid most commonly used for miscible displacement is carbon dioxide because it reduces the oil viscosity and is less expensive than liquefied petroleum gas.

electromagnetic heating,"A process to increase thermal energy in a reservoir using electromagnetic means. The two types of electromagnetic heating are conductive and radio frequency (RF). In conductive heating, a current passes from one electrode through the formation to a second electrode. Electrical resistance of the reservoir brine generates thermal energy, heating the reservoir. In RF heating, transmitters in the wellbore generate electromagnetic waves with frequencies in the microwave range that are directed into the formation. The waves interact with water molecules, generating heat in much the same way a microwave oven does. Since both methods rely on water to transfer thermal energy to the reservoir, higher water saturation increases the efficiency of the heat transfer.",Noun,Enhanced Oil Recovery,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electromagnetic_heating
