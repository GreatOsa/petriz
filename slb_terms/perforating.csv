firing head,"A mechanical or electronic device used to detonate perforating charges conveyed by tubing, drillpipe, coiled tubing or slickline. This term thus connotes any such device that is not initiated electrically from surface by wireline. A mechanical firing head consists of a percussion detonator that is struck by a firing pin. An electronic firing head is battery powered, to initiate an electric detonator. Electronic firing head systems are used with slickline, coiled tubing and TCP.",Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/firing_head
fill sub,A pipe-shaped housing that protects the firing head of a tubing-conveyed perforating gun. It is used to accommodate or deflect debris that might fall toward the firing head while running into the hole or while on depth before shooting.,Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fill_sub
frac gun,"A specialized perforating-gun system that contains shaped charges loaded at 0째, 60째, 120째, or 180째 phase angles to provide a casing entrance hole of approximately 0.5 in. [1.3 cm], which is intended to be large enough for hydraulic fracturing operations.",Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_gun
gun clearance,"The distance between the external surface of the gun assembly and the internal surface of the casing or liner. The gun clearance depends on the position of the gun within the tubular and will vary between phases of shots on any gun unless the gun assembly is centralized. This variation in clearance contributes to variable performance of the perforations. The greater the gun clearance, the smaller the entrance hole-with the effect increasing with depth (pressure).",Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gun_clearance
gun,"Abbreviation for air gun or water gun. An air gun is a source of seismic energy used in acquisition of marine seismic data. This gun releases highly compressed air into water. Air guns are also used in water-filled pits on land as an energy source during acquisition of vertical seismic profiles. A water gun is a source of energy for acquisition of marine seismic data that shoots water from a chamber in the tool into a larger body of water, creating cavitation. The cavity is a vacuum and implodes without creating secondary bubbles. This provides a short time signature and higher resolution than an air-gun source.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gun
gun zero,"The point on a gun assembly or perforating string that is used when correlating depth. With use of a surface depth reference or datum point, any convenient point may be used, providing it is applied accurately and consistently. For downhole correlation on wireline applications, the gun zero point will relate to the correlating device, such as the casing collar locator (CCL) or gamma ray log tool. For nonwireline applications, the gun zero point will relate to the locating device, such as the tubing-end locator. The correlation process is crucial to a successful perforating operation; and therefore the importance of ensuring correct placement of the gun assembly prior to firing cannot be overstated.",Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gun_zero

big hole charge,"A perforating charge designed to create perforations with a large-diameter entrance hole. These charges typically are used in sand control completions, in which efficient placement of the gravel pack treatment within the perforation tunnel is crucial. Altering the explosive charge design and materials creates a larger diameter entrance hole on the perforation while reducing the depth of penetration. However, gravel-pack treatments generally are applied in high-permeability formations where perforation tunnel length is less important. Wells that are to be hydraulically fractured also can benefit from larger perforations since the effective penetration is significantly increased by a high-conductivity fracture.",Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/big_hole_charge

chemical cutter,"A downhole tool run on wireline to sever tubing at a predetermined point when the tubing string becomes stuck. When activated, the chemical cutter use a small explosive charge to forcefully direct high-pressure jets of highly corrosive material in a circumferential pattern against the tubular wall. The nearly instantaneous massive corrosion of the surrounding tubing wall creates a relatively even cut with minimal distortion of the tubing, aiding subsequent fishing operations.",Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/chemical_cutter
crushed zone,"The rubblized rock just below the tooth of a rock bit. Rock in the crushed zone fails due to the high compressive stress placed on it by the bit tooth (in the case of a roller-cone bit).

damaged zone,"The area surrounding the wellbore that has been harmed by the drilling process, generally as a result of mud or cement-filtrate invasion. Near-wellbore damage can significantly affect productivity and is typically easier to prevent than it is to cure. Although almost always present, a lightly damaged zone around the wellbore can be bypassed by perforation tunnels to create connecting conduits from the wellbore to the undamaged reservoir formation. More severe cases of damage may require a matrix-acidizing treatment to restore the natural permeability, or a hydraulic fracturing treatment to create a new high-conductivity flow path to the reservoir.",Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/damaged_zone

dropoff gun,"A perforating gun assembly designed to be detached from the tubing or running string after firing. The detached assembly can then drop, or be pushed, to the bottom of the well depending on deviation and production requirements. Dropoff gun assemblies often are used in underbalanced perforating applications, eliminating the need to kill the well to recover the spent gun assembly. In such cases, the wellbore will be designed to accommodate the spent gun assembly without compromising productivity, while recovery of the gun assembly may be planned during subsequent workover operations. The dropoff mechanism may be automatic and actuated at time of firing, or be actuated after firing.",Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dropoff_gun

radio silence,"A procedure imposed during perforating operations in which radios at or near the wellsite are switched off to prevent accidental detonation of perforating guns. Radio silence is required for wireline operations when using a non-radio-safe detonator. It is typically imposed when rigging up perforating guns and until the guns have been run in the hole to 200 ft [61 m] below ground level or mud line. Radio silence is imposed again when retrieving the gun system as it passes the 200-ft mark. Radio silence must be maintained until it has been confirmed that all charges have been shot. This practice is not required when radio-safe detonators are used, but is common practice at many wellsites.",Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/radio_silence
radio-safe detonator,"Electric detonators used in wireline and electronic firing-head perforating operations, which are immune to radio interference and thus cannot be accidentally triggered by radio transmissions.",Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/radio-safe_detonator
