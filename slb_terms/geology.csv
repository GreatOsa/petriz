Outside North America, shale gas potential is being pursued in many parts of Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/exploration_play
exploratory,"Pertaining to exploration, the initial phase in petroleum operations that includes generation of a prospect or play or both, and drilling of an exploration well. Appraisal, development and production phases follow successful exploration.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/exploratory
estuarine,"Pertaining to an estuary, a semi-enclosed coastal environment of deposition in which a river mouth permits freshwater to contact and mix with seawater.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/estuarine
evaporite,"A class of sedimentary minerals and sedimentary rocks that form by precipitation from evaporating aqueous fluid. Common evaporite minerals are halite, gypsum and anhydrite, which can form as seawater evaporates, and the rocks limestone and dolostone. Certain evaporite minerals, particularly halite, can form excellent cap rocks or seals for hydrocarbon traps because they have minimal porosity and they tend to deform plastically (as opposed to brittle fracturing that would facilitate leakage).",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/evaporite
eustatic,"Pertaining to eustasy, a term for global sea level and its variations. Changes in sea level can result from movement of tectonic plates altering the volume of ocean basins, or when changes in climate affect the volume of water stored in glaciers and in polar icecaps.

erosion,"The process of denudation of rocks, including physical, chemical and biological breakdown and transportation.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/erosion
earthquake,"The sudden release of accumulated stress in the Earth by movement or shaking. Earthquakes are caused by tectonic activity, volcanoes, and human activity (such as explosions). Earthquakes occur in the outer 720 km [445 miles] of the Earth, where rocks tend to break rather than flow under stress. The magnitude of earthquakes is determined according to the logarithmic Richter scale. An earthquake of magnitude 4.5 can cause damage, although humans can feel earthquakes as weak as magnitude 2.0. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 measured 8.25 on the Richter scale, and the largest ever recorded were 8.9 magnitude earthquakes in Colombia and Ecuador (1906) and Japan (1933), and 9.5 in Chile (1960).",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/earthquake

effective permeability,"The ability to preferentially flow or transmit a particular fluid when other immiscible fluids are present in the reservoir (e.g., effective permeability of gas in a gas-water reservoir). The relative saturations of the fluids as well as the nature of the reservoir affect the effective permeability. In contrast, absolute permeability is the measurement of the permeability conducted when a single fluid or phase is present in the rock.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/effective_permeability
flower structure,"Folded structures associated with strike-slip faults. In areas where strike-slip faults occur in converging crust, or transpression, rocks are faulted upward in a positive flower structure. In areas of strike-slip faulting in diverging crust, or transtension, rocks drop down to form a negative flower structure. Flower structures can form hydrocarbon traps. The term ""flower structure"" reflects the resemblance of the structure to the petals of a flower in cross section.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flower_structure
fairway,"The trend along which a particular geological feature is likely, such as a sand fairway or a hydrocarbon fairway. Prediction of conceptual fairways helps explorationists develop prospects.

free water,"Water that is mobile, available to flow, and not bound to surfaces of grains or minerals in rock.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/free_water
fault,"A break or planar surface in brittle rock across which there is observable displacement. Depending on the relative direction of displacement between the rocks, or fault blocks, on either side of the fault, its movement is described as normal, reverse or strike-slip. According to terminology derived from the mining industry, the fault block above the fault surface is called the hanging wall, while the fault block below the fault is the footwall. Given the geological complexity of some faulted rocks and rocks that have undergone more than one episode of deformation, it can be difficult to distinguish between the various types of faults. Also, areas deformed more than once or that have undergone continual deformation might have fault surfaces that are rotated from their original orientations, so interpretation is not straightforward. In a normal fault, the hanging wall moves down relative to the footwall along the dip of the fault surface, which is steep, from 45o to 90o. A growth fault is a type of normal fault that forms during sedimentation and typically has thicker strata on the downthrown hanging wall than the footwall. A reverse fault forms when the hanging wall moves up relative to the footwall parallel to the dip of the fault surface. A thrust fault, sometimes called an overthrust, is a reverse fault in which the fault plane has a shallow dip, typically much less than 45o. Movement of normal and reverse faults can also be oblique as opposed to purely parallel to the dip direction of the fault plane. The motion along a strike-slip fault, also known as a transcurrent or wrench fault, is parallel to the strike of the fault surface, and the fault blocks move sideways past each other. The fault surfaces of strike-slip faults are usually nearly vertical. A strike-slip fault in which the block across the fault moves to the right is described as a dextral strike-slip fault. If it moves left, the relative motion is described as sinistral. A transform fault is a particular type of strike-slip fault that is a boundary of an oceanic tectonic plate. The actual movement of a transform fault is opposite to its apparent displacement. The presence of a fault can be detected by observing characteristics of rocks such as changes in lithology from one fault block to the next, breaks and offsets between strata or seismic events, and changes in formation pressure in wells that penetrate both sides of a fault. Some fault surfaces contain relatively coarse rubble that can act as a conduit for migrating oil or gas, whereas the surfaces of other faults are smeared with impermeable clays or broken grains that can act as a fault seal.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fault
feldspar,"[alkali feldspar (K,Na)AlSi3O8]
[plagioclase feldspar NaAlSi3O8 - CaAl2Si2O8] A group of rock-forming silicate minerals that are essential constituents of igneous rocks and are common in sandstones. Feldspar can weather to form clay minerals. Feldspar can occur in all three major rock types and forms approximately 60% of the crust of the Earth.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/feldspar

fabric,"Rock fabric: Fabric refers to the spacing, arrangement, distribution, size, shape, and orientation of the constituents of rocks, such as minerals, grains, porosity, layering, bed boundaries, lithology contacts, and fractures.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fabric
fracture,"A crack or surface of breakage within rock not related to foliation or cleavage in metamorphic rock along which there has been no movement. A fracture along which there has been displacement is a fault. When walls of a fracture have moved only normal to each other, the fracture is called a joint. Fractures can enhance permeability of rocks greatly by connecting pores together, and for that reason, fractures are induced mechanically in some reservoirs in order to boost hydrocarbon flow. Fractures may also be referred to as natural fractures to distinguish them from fractures induced as part of a reservoir stimulation or drilling operation. In some shale reservoirs, natural fractures improve production by enhancing effective permeability. In other cases, natural fractures can complicate reservoir stimulation.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracture
facies,"The overall characteristics of a rock unit that reflect its origin and differentiate the unit from others around it. Mineralogy and sedimentary source, fossil content, sedimentary structures and texture distinguish one facies from another.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/facies
fracture permeability,"That portion of a dual-porosity reservoirs permeability that is associated with the secondary porosity created by open, natural fractures. In many of these reservoirs, fracture permeability can be the major controlling factor of the flow of fluids.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracture_permeability
fresh water,"Formation water with low salinity. Water is considered fresh when its low conductivity makes the interpretation of resistivity logs difficult. The salinity at which this becomes important depends on temperature and clay content, among other factors, but is generally somewhere less than 10 ppk.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fresh_water
field,"An accumulation, pool, or group of pools of hydrocarbons or other mineral resources in the subsurface.

Typically, the term implies an economic size.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/field
fracture porosity,"A type of secondary porosity produced by the tectonic fracturing of rock. Fractures themselves typically do not have much volume, but by joining preexisting pores, they enhance permeability significantly. In exceedingly rare cases, nonreservoir rocks such as granite can become reservoir rocks if sufficient fracturing occurs.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracture_porosity
fracture gradient,The pressure required to induce fractures in rock at a given depth.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracture_gradient
free gas,The gaseous phase present in a reservoir or other contained area.

Both free gas and dissolved gas play important roles in the reservoir-drive mechanism.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/free_gas
formation water,"Water that occurs naturally within the pores of rock. Water from fluids introduced to a formation through drilling or other interference, such as mud and seawater, does not constitute formation water. Formation water, or interstitial water, might not have been the water present when the rock originally formed. In contrast, connate water is the water trapped in the pores of a rock during its formation, and may be called fossil water.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_water
formation pressure,"The pressure of fluids within the pores of a reservoir, usually hydrostatic pressure, or the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level. When impermeable rocks such as shales form as sediments are compacted, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to anomalously high formation pressures. Because reservoir pressure changes as fluids are produced from a reservoir, the pressure should be described as measured at a specific time, such as initial reservoir pressure.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_pressure
formation,"The fundamental unit of lithostratigraphy. A body of rock that is sufficiently distinctive and continuous that it can be mapped. In stratigraphy, a formation is a body of strata of predominantly one type or combination of types; multiple formations form groups, and subdivisions of formations are members.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation
fold,"A wave-like geologic structure that forms when rocks deform by bending instead of breaking under compressional stress. Anticlines are arch-shaped folds in which rock layers are upwardly convex. The oldest rock layers form the core of the fold, and outward from the core progressively younger rocks occur. A syncline is the opposite type of fold, having downwardly convex layers with young rocks in the core. Folds typically occur in anticline-syncline pairs. The hinge is the point of maximum curvature in a fold. The limbs occur on either side of the fold hinge. The imaginary surface bisecting the limbs of the fold is called the axial surface. The axial surface is called the axial plane in cases where the fold is symmetrical and the lines containing the points of maximum curvature of the folded layers, or hinge lines, are coplanar. Concentric folding preserves the thickness of each bed as measured perpendicular to original bedding. Similar folds have the same wave shape, but bed thickness changes throughout each layer, with thicker hinges and thinner limbs.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fold
fluid contact,"The interface that separates fluids of different densities in a reservoir. Horizontal contacts are usually assumed, although tilted contacts occur in some reservoirs. The contact between fluids is usually gradual rather than sharp, forming a transition zone of mixed fluid. A mixed-fluid reservoir will stratify according to fluid density, with gas at the top, oil in the middle, and water below. Production of fluids often perturbs the fluid contacts in a reservoir.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fluid_contact
fluvial,"Pertaining to an environment of deposition by a river or running water. Fluvial deposits tend to be well sorted, especially in comparison with alluvial deposits, because of the relatively steady transport provided by rivers.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fluvial
geomagnetic polarity time scale,"A record of the onset and duration of the multitude of episodes of reversal of the Earth's magnetic polarity, or geomagnetic polarity reversals. The GPTS was developed by thorough study of rocks from around the world, during which it was observed that rocks from specific time periods contained magnetic minerals whose orientation was opposite to that of the current magnetic field. By comparing the patterns of magnetic reversals with those of rocks of known age, the approximate ages of rocks can be established.

geomagnetic polarity reversal,"The periodic switching of the magnetic north and south poles of the Earth throughout time, probably as a result of movement of fluid within the Earth's core. The onset and duration of the many episodes of reversed polarity have been documented by examining the polarity of magnetic minerals within rocks of different ages from around the world, particularly in basalts or igneous rocks of the oceanic crust. Oceanic basalts record the Earth's magnetic field as they solidify from molten lava symmetrically on each side of the midoceanic ridges. These data have been compiled to create a time scale known as the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS). In the oil field, borehole recordings allow direct correlation to GPTS and well-to-well correlations.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/geomagnetic_polarity_reversal

Relative age, in contrast, is the approximate age of rocks, fossils or minerals made by determining the age of the material relative to other surrounding material.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/geochronology
generation,"The formation of hydrocarbons from a source rock as bitumen forms from kerogen and accumulates as oil or gas. Generation depends on three main factors: the presence of organic matter rich enough to yield hydrocarbons, adequate temperature, and sufficient time to bring the source rock to maturity. Pressure and the presence of bacteria and catalysts also affect generation. Generation is a critical phase in the development of a petroleum system.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/generation
gypsum,[CaSO472H2O] A highly insoluble sulfate mineral that is the first to precipitate from evaporating seawater. Dehydration of gypsum can produce anhydrite. Fine-grained gypsum is called alabaster.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gypsum

gas in solution,"Gas that is dissolved in a liquid, such as water or oil.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gas_in_solution
geopressure,"The pressure within the Earth, or formation pressure. The common oilfield usage, however, is to indicate anomalous subsurface pore pressure that is higher or lower than the normal, predicted hydrostatic pressure for a given depth, or the pressure exerted per unit area by a column of fresh water from sea level to a given depth. Abnormally low pore pressure might occur in areas where fluids have been drained, such as a depleted hydrocarbon reservoir. Abnormally high pore pressure might occur in areas where burial of water-filled sediments by an impermeable sediment such as clay was so rapid that fluids could not escape and the pore pressure increased with deeper burial.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/geopressure
gas hydrate,"An unusual occurrence of hydrocarbon in which molecules of natural gas, typically methane, are trapped in ice molecules. More generally, hydrates are compounds in which gas molecules are trapped within a crystal structure. Hydrates form in cold climates, such as permafrost zones and in deep water. To date, economic liberation of hydrocarbon gases from hydrates has not occurred, but hydrates contain quantities of hydrocarbons that could be of great economic significance. Hydrates can affect seismic data by creating a reflection or multiple.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gas_hydrate

core,"To deepen the wellbore by way of collecting a cylindrical sample of rock. A core bit is used to accomplish this, in conjunction with a core barrel and core catcher. The bit is usually a drag bit fitted with either PDC or natural diamond cutting structures, but the core bit is unusual in that it has a hole in its center. This allows the bit to drill around a central cylinder of rock, which is taken in through the bit and into the core barrel. The core barrel itself may be thought of as a special storage chamber for holding the rock core. The core catcher serves to grip the bottom of the core and, as tension is applied to the drillstring, the rock under the core breaks away from the undrilled formation below it. The core catcher also retains the core so that it does not fall out the bottom of the drillstring, which is open in the middle at that point.",Verb,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/core

Typical consequences of consolidation include an increase in density and acoustic velocity, and a decrease in porosity.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/consolidation
contact,"The interface, also called fluid contact, that separates fluids of different densities in a reservoir. Horizontal contacts are usually assumed, although tilted contacts occur in some reservoirs. The contact between fluids is usually gradual rather than sharp, forming a transition zone of mixed fluid. A mixed-fluid reservoir will stratify according to fluid density, with gas at the top, oil in the middle, and water below. Production of fluids often perturbs the fluid contacts in a reservoir.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/contact
condensed section,"In sequence stratigraphy, a section of fine-grained sedimentary rocks that accumulated slowly, thereby representing a considerable span of time by only a thin layer. In condensed sections, fossils and organic, phosphatic and glauconitic material tend to be concentrated compared with rapidly deposited sections that contain few fossils. Condensed sections are most commonly deposited during transgressions. In such cases they are associated with ""maximum flooding surfaces"" and form important sequence stratigraphic markers.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/condensed_section
connate water,"Water trapped in the pores of a rock during formation of the rock. The chemistry of connate water can change in composition throughout the history of the rock. Connate water can be dense and saline compared with seawater. Formation water, or interstitial water, in contrast, is simply water found in the pore spaces of a rock, and might not have been present when the rock was formed. Connate water is also described as fossil water.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/connate_water
concentric fold,"The deformation of rock layers in which the thickness of each layer, measured perpendicular to initial undeformed layering, is maintained after the rock layers have been folded.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/concentric_fold
condensate,"A low-density, high-API gravity liquid hydrocarbon phase that generally occurs in association with natural gas. Its presence as a liquid phase depends on temperature and pressure conditions in the reservoir allowing condensation of liquid from vapor. The production of condensate reservoirs can be complicated because of the pressure sensitivity of some condensates: During production, there is a risk of the condensate changing from gas to liquid if the reservoir pressure drops below the dew point during production. Reservoir pressure can be maintained by fluid injection if gas production is preferable to liquid production. Gas produced in association with condensate is called wet gas. The API gravity of condensate is typically 50 degrees to 120 degrees.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/condensate
competent,"Describes a bed that maintains its original thickness during deformation. Often pertains to relatively brittle, solid strata that deform by faulting, fracturing or folding, rather than flowing under stress. Incompetent beds are more ductile and tend to flow under stress, so their bed thickness changes more readily during deformation.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/competent

deepwater play,"Exploration activity located in offshore areas where water depths exceed approximately 600 feet [200 m], the approximate water depth at the edge of the continental shelf. While deep-water reservoir targets are geologically similar to reservoirs drilled both in shallower present-day water depths as well as onshore, the logistics of producing hydrocarbons from reservoirs located below such water depths presents a considerable technical challenge.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/deepwater_play

The dominant depositional systems are alluvial, fluvial, deltaic, marine, lacustrine and eolian systems.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depositional_system
depositional energy,"The relative kinetic energy of the environment. A high-energy environment might consist of a rapidly flowing stream that is capable of carrying coarse-grained sediments, such as gravel and sand. Sedimentation in a low-energy environment, such as an abyssal plain, usually involves very fine-grained clay or mud. Depositional energy is not simply velocity. For example, although glaciers do not move quickly, they are capable of carrying large boulders.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depositional_energy
differential compaction,"A phenomenon that occurs after the deposition of some sediments such that different parts of the sedimentary accumulation develop different degrees of porosity or settle unevenly during burial beneath successive layers of sediment. This can result from location on an uneven surface, such as near and over a reef structure, or near a growth fault, or from different susceptibility to compaction. The porosity in a formation that has experienced differential compaction can vary considerably from one area to another.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/differential_compaction
delta,"An area of deposition or the deposit formed by a flowing sediment-laden current as it enters an open or standing body of water, such as a river spilling into a gulf. As a river enters a body of water, its velocity drops and its ability to carry sediment diminishes, leading to deposition. The term has origins in Greek because the shape of deltas in map view can be similar to the Greek letter delta. The shapes of deltas are subsequently modified by rivers, tides and waves. There is a characteristic coarsening upward of sediments in a delta. The three main classes of deltas are river-dominated (Mississippi River), wave-dominated (Nile River), and tide-dominated (Ganges River).

density,"Mass per unit of volume. Density is typically reported in g/cm3 (for example, rocks) or pounds per barrel (drilling mud) in the oil field.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/density
density current,"An influx of rapidly moving, sediment-laden water down a slope into a larger body of water; the suspended sediment causes the current to have a higher density than the clearer water into which it flows, hence the name. Such currents can occur in lakes and oceans, in some cases as by-products of earthquakes or mass movements such as slumps. The sedimentary deposits that form as the current loses energy are called turbidites and can be preserved as Bouma sequences. Density currents are characteristic of trench slopes of convergent plate margins and continental slopes of passive margins.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/density_current
diagenesis,"The physical, chemical or biological alteration of sediments into sedimentary rock at relatively low temperatures and pressures that can result in changes to the rock's original mineralogy and texture. After deposition, sediments are compacted as they are buried beneath successive layers of sediment and cemented by minerals that precipitate from solution. Grains of sediment, rock fragments and fossils can be replaced by other minerals during diagenesis. Porosity usually decreases during diagenesis, except in rare cases such as dissolution of minerals and dolomitization. Diagenesis does not include weathering processes. Hydrocarbon generation begins during diagenesis. There is not a clear, accepted distinction between diagenesis and metamorphism, although metamorphism occurs at pressures and temperatures higher than those of the outer crust, where diagenesis occurs.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diagenesis
diatom,"A microscopic, single-celled, freshwater or saltwater algae that has a silica-rich cell wall called a frustule. Diatoms are so abundant that they can form thick layers of sediment composed of the frustules of the organisms that died and sank to the bottom. Frustules have been an important component of deep-sea deposits since Cretaceous time. Diatomite is the sedimentary rock that forms from diatom frustules.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diatom

diagenetic porosity,"A type of secondary porosity created during diagenesis, commonly through dissolution or dolomitization or both. Diagenesis usually destroys porosity, so diagenetic porosity is rare.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diagenetic_porosity
diapir,"A relatively mobile mass that intrudes into preexisting rocks. Diapirs commonly intrude vertically through more dense rocks because of buoyancy forces associated with relatively low-density rock types, such as salt, shale and hot magma, which form diapirs. The process is known as diapirism. By pushing upward and piercing overlying rock layers, diapirs can form anticlines, salt domes and other structures capable of trapping hydrocarbons. Igneous intrusions are typically too hot to allow the preservation of preexisting hydrocarbons.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diapir
diatomaceous,"Pertaining to a diatom, which is a microscopic, single-celled, freshwater or saltwater algae that has a silica-rich cell wall called a frustule.

development,"The phase of petroleum operations that occurs after exploration has proven successful, and before full-scale production. The newly discovered oil or gas field is assessed during an appraisal phase, a plan to fully and efficiently exploit it is created, and additional wells are usually drilled.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/development
detrital,"Pertaining to particles of rock derived from the mechanical breakdown of preexisting rocks by weathering and erosion. Detrital fragments can be transported to recombine and, through the process of lithification, become sedimentary rocks. Detrital is usually used synonymously with clastic, although a few authors differentiate between weathering of particles, which forms detrital sediments, and mechanical breakage, which produces clastic sediments.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/detrital

dolomitization,"The geochemical process in supratidal sabkha areas where magnesium [Mg] ions from the evaporation of seawater replace calcium [Ca] ions in calcite, forming the mineral dolomite. The volume of dolomite is less than that of calcite, so the replacement of calcite by dolomite in a rock increases the pore space in the rock by 13% and forms an important reservoir rock. Dolomitization can occur during deep burial diagenesis.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dolomitization

radial faulting,"Multiple faults whose fault planes strike outward from a common center. Such faults typically are associated with salt domes, impact craters or volcanoes.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/radial_faulting
rock,"An aggregate of minerals or organic matter (in the case of coal, which is not composed of minerals because of its organic origin), or volcanic glass (obsidian, which forms a rock but is not considered a mineral because of its amorphous, noncrystalline nature). Rocks can contain a single mineral, such as rock salt (halite) and certain limestones (calcite), or many minerals, such as granite (quartz, feldspar, mica and other minerals). There are three main types of rocks. Sedimentary rocks like sandstone and limestone form at the Earth's surface through deposition of sediments derived from weathered rocks, biogenic activity or precipitation from solution. Igneous rocks originate deeper within the Earth, where the temperature is high enough to melt rocks, to form magma that can crystallize within the Earth or at the surface by volcanic activity. Metamorphic rocks form from other preexisting rocks during episodes of deformation of the Earth at temperatures and pressures high enough to alter minerals but inadequate to melt them. Such changes can occur by the activity of fluids in the Earth and movement of igneous bodies or regional tectonic activity. Rocks are recycled from one type to another by the constant changes in the Earth.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/rock
rhombohedral packing,"The most compact arrangement in space of uniform spheres (atoms and molecules in mineral crystals, or grains in sedimentary rocks) that results in a structure having no more than 26% porosity. Rhombohedral packing is more stable mechanically than cubic packing. Cubic packing is the most porous packing arrangement, with about 47% porosity in the ideal situation. Most sediments, however, are not uniform spheres of the same size, nor can they be arranged in a cubic structure naturally, so most sediments have much less than 47% porosity of ideal cubic packing and commonly less than the 26% porosity of ideal rhombohedral packing.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/rhombohedral_packing

reef,"A mound, ridge, or buildup of sediment or sedimentary rock, most commonly produced by organisms that secrete shells such as corals. Reefs are typically taller than the sediment that surrounds them, resistant to weathering and wave action, and preserved within sediment of a different composition. Carbonate reefs form in a limited range of temperatures, water depths, salinities and wave activities, so their occurrence can be used to interpret past environmental conditions. Because the rocks that surround reefs can differ in composition and permeability, porous reefs can form stratigraphic traps for hydrocarbons. Porosity of reefal limestones depends on post-depositional diagenetic changes.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reef

relative age,"The approximate age determination of rocks, fossils or minerals made by comparing whether the material is younger or older than other surrounding material. Relative age is estimated according to stratigraphic and structural relationships, such as superposition, and by fossil content, since the relative ages and successions of fossils have been established by paleontologists. The measurement of the decay of radioactive isotopes, especially uranium, rubidium, argon and carbon, has allowed geologists to more precisely determine the age in years of rock formations, known as the absolute age. Tree rings and seasonal sedimentary deposits called varves can be counted to determine absolute age. Although the term implies otherwise, ""absolute"" ages typically have some amount of potential error and are inexact.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/relative_age
relative permeability,"A dimensionless term devised to adapt the Darcy equation to multiphase flow conditions. Relative permeability is the ratio of effective permeability of a particular fluid at a particular saturation to absolute permeability of that fluid at total saturation. If a single fluid is present in a rock, its relative permeability is 1.0. Calculation of relative permeability allows comparison of the different abilities of fluids to flow in the presence of each other, since the presence of more than one fluid generally inhibits flow.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/relative_permeability
kerogen,"The naturally occurring, solid, insoluble organic matter that occurs in source rocks and can yield oil upon heating. Kerogen is the portion of naturally occurring organic matter that is nonextractable using organic solvents. Typical organic constituents of kerogen are algae and woody plant material.

lithosphere,"The brittle outer layer of the Earth that includes the crust and uppermost mantle. It is made up of six major and several minor tectonic plates that move around on the softer asthenosphere. The lithosphere of the oceans tends to be thinner (in some oceanic areas, less than 50 km [30 miles] thick) and more dense than that of the continents (more than 120 km [70 miles] thick in places like the Himalayas) because of isostasy. The movement of the plates of the lithosphere results in convergence, or collisions, that can form mountain belts and subduction zones, and divergence of the plates and the creation of new crust as material wells up from below separating plates.

igneous,"Pertaining to one of three main classes of rocks (igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary). Igneous rocks crystallize from molten rock, or magma, with interlocking mineral crystals. Igneous rocks that crystallize slowly, typically below the surface of the Earth, are plutonic igneous rocks and have large crystals (large enough to see with the naked eye). Volcanic igneous rocks crystallize quickly at the Earth's surface and have small crystals (usually too small to see without magnification).

Impermeable rocks are desirable sealing rocks or cap rocks for reservoirs because hydrocarbons cannot pass through them readily.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/impermeable
injectite,"Structures formed by sediment injection. Because they resemble intrusive and extrusive igneous features, much of the vocabulary for describing injectites, or clastic intrusions, comes from igneous geology. Sills are emplaced parallel to bedding, whereas dikes cut through bedding. The strata containing the intrusion are called host strata and the layers that feed the intrusion are the parent beds. Sand-injection features exhibit size scales from millimeters to kilometers, and have been seen in cores, borehole image logs, seismic sections, outcrops, aerial photographs and satellite images.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/injectite

Isopachs and isochores are equivalent only if the rock layer is horizontal.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/isochore
interstitial water,"Water that occurs naturally within the pores of rock. Water from fluids introduced to a formation through drilling or other interference, such as mud and seawater, does not constitute interstitial water. Interstitial water, or formation water, might not have been the water present when the rock originally formed. In contrast, connate water is the water trapped in the pores of a rock during its formation, also called fossil water.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/interstitial_water
isopach,"A contour that connects points of equal thickness. Commonly, the isopachs, or contours that make up an isopach map, display the stratigraphic thickness of a rock unit as opposed to the true vertical thickness.

natural fracture,"A crack or surface of breakage within rock not related to foliation or cleavage in metamorphic rock along which there has been no movement. A fracture along which there has been displacement is a fault. When walls of a fracture have moved only normal to each other, the fracture is called a joint. Fractures can enhance permeability of rocks greatly by connecting pores together, and for that reason, fractures are induced mechanically in some reservoirs in order to boost hydrocarbon flow. Fractures may also be referred to as natural fractures to distinguish them from fractures induced as part of a reservoir stimulation or drilling operation. In some shale reservoirs, natural fractures improve production by enhancing effective permeability. In other cases, natural fractures can complicate reservoir stimulation.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/natural_fracture

Marine source rocks are commonly oil-prone.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oil-prone
overpressure,"Subsurface pressure that is abnormally high, exceeding hydrostatic pressure at a given depth. The term geopressure is commonly, and incorrectly, used synonymously. Abnormally high pore pressure can occur in areas where burial of fluid-filled sediments is so rapid that pore fluids cannot escape, so the pressure of the pore fluids increases as overburden increases. Drilling into overpressured strata can be hazardous because overpressured fluids escape rapidly, so careful preparation is made in areas of known overpressure.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/overpressure

plate tectonics,"The unifying geologic theory developed to explain observations that interactions of the brittle plates of the lithosphere with each other and with the softer underlying asthenosphere result in large-scale changes in the Earth. The theory of plate tectonics initially stemmed from observations of the shapes of the continents, particularly South America and Africa, which fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle and have similar rocks and fossils despite being separated by a modern ocean. As lithospheric plates heat up or cool down depending on their position, or their tectonic environment, relative to each other and to warmer areas deeper within the Earth, they become relatively more or less dense than the asthenosphere and thus tend to rise as molten magma or sink in cold, brittle slabs or slide past each other. Mountain belts can form during plate collisions or an orogeny; diverging plates or rifts can create new midoceanic ridges; plates that slide past one another create transform fault zones (such as the San Andreas fault); and zones of subduction occur where one lithospheric plate moves beneath another. Plate tectonic theory can explain such phenomena as earthquakes, volcanic or other igneous activity, midoceanic ridges and the relative youth of the oceanic crust, and the formation of sedimentary basins on the basis of their relationships to lithospheric plate boundaries. Convection of the mantle is postulated to be the driving mechanism for the movement of lithospheric plates. Measurements of the continents using the Global Positioning System confirm the relative motions of plates. Age determinations of the oceanic crust confirm that such crust is much younger than that of the continents and has been recycled by the process of subduction and regenerated at midoceanic ridges.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/plate_tectonics

permeability,"The ability, or measurement of a rock's ability, to transmit fluids, typically measured in darcies or millidarcies. The term was basically defined by Henry Darcy, who showed that the common mathematics of heat transfer could be modified to adequately describe fluid flow in porous media. Formations that transmit fluids readily, such as sandstones, are described as permeable and tend to have many large, well-connected pores. Impermeable formations, such as shales and siltstones, tend to be finer grained or of a mixed grain size, with smaller, fewer, or less interconnected pores. Absolute permeability is the measurement of the permeability conducted when a single fluid, or phase, is present in the rock. Effective permeability is the ability to preferentially flow or transmit a particular fluid through a rock when other immiscible fluids are present in the reservoir (for example, effective permeability of gas in a gas-water reservoir). The relative saturations of the fluids as well as the nature of the reservoir affect the effective permeability. Relative permeability is the ratio of effective permeability of a particular fluid at a particular saturation to absolute permeability of that fluid at total saturation. If a single fluid is present in a rock, its relative permeability is 1.0. Calculation of relative permeability allows for comparison of the different abilities of fluids to flow in the presence of each other, since the presence of more than one fluid generally inhibits flow.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/permeability

prospect,"An area of exploration in which hydrocarbons have been predicted to exist in economic quantity. A prospect is commonly an anomaly, such as a geologic structure or a seismic amplitude anomaly, that is recommended by explorationists for drilling a well. Justification for drilling a prospect is made by assembling evidence for an active petroleum system, or reasonable probability of encountering reservoir-quality rock, a trap of sufficient size, adequate sealing rock, and appropriate conditions for generation and migration of hydrocarbons to fill the trap. A single drilling location is also called a prospect, but the term is more properly used in the context of exploration.

When impermeable rocks such as shales form as sediments are compacted, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to anomalously high formation pressures. Because reservoir pressure changes as fluids are produced from a reservoir, the pressure should be described as measured at a specific time, such as initial reservoir pressure.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pore_pressure
porosity,"The percentage of pore volume or void space, or that volume within rock that can contain fluids. Porosity can be a relic of deposition (primary porosity, such as space between grains that were not compacted together completely) or can develop through alteration of the rock (secondary porosity, such as when feldspar grains or fossils are preferentially dissolved from sandstones). Porosity can be generated by the development of fractures, in which case it is called fracture porosity. Effective porosity is the interconnected pore volume in a rock that contributes to fluid flow in a reservoir. It excludes isolated pores. Total porosity is the total void space in the rock whether or not it contributes to fluid flow. Thus, effective porosity is typically less than total porosity. Shale gas reservoirs tend to have relatively high porosity, but the alignment of platy grains such as clays makes their permeability very low.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/porosity

unconventional resource,"An umbrella term for oil and natural gas that is produced by means that do not meet the criteria for conventional production. What has qualified as unconventional at any particular time is a complex function of resource characteristics, the available exploration and production technologies, the economic environment, and the scale, frequency and duration of production from the resource. Perceptions of these factors inevitably change over time and often differ among users of the term. At present, the term is used in reference to oil and gas resources whose porosity, permeability, fluid trapping mechanism, or other characteristics differ from conventional sandstone and carbonate reservoirs.

secondary porosity,"The porosity created through alteration of rock, commonly by processes such as dolomitization, dissolution and fracturing.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/secondary_porosity
sedimentary basin,"A depression in the crust of the Earth formed by plate tectonic activity in which sediments accumulate. Continued deposition can cause further depression or subsidence. Sedimentary basins, or simply basins, vary from bowl-shaped to elongated troughs. If rich hydrocarbon source rocks occur in combination with appropriate depth and duration of burial, hydrocarbon generation can occur within the basin.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sedimentary_basin
strike-slip fault,"A type of fault whose surface is typically vertical or nearly so. The motion along a strike-slip fault is parallel to the strike of the fault surface, and the fault blocks move sideways past each other. A strike-slip fault in which the block across the fault moves to the right is described as a dextral strike-slip fault. If it moves left, the relative motion is described as sinistral. Local deformation near bends in strike-slip faults can produce pull-apart basins and grabens. Flower structures are another by-product of strike-slip faults. A wrench fault is a type of strike-slip fault in which the fault surface is nearly vertical.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/strike-slip_fault
subsalt,"An exploration and production play type in which prospects exist below salt layers. Until relatively recently, many explorationists did not seek prospects below salt because seismic data had been of poor quality below salt (i.e., it was not possible to map traps accurately) or because they believed that reservoir-quality rock or hydrocarbons did not exist below salt layers. Advances in seismic processing and compelling drilling results from exploration wells encouraged companies to generate and drill prospects below salt layers, salt sheets and other previously disregarded potential traps. The offshore Gulf of Mexico contains numerous subsalt-producing fields, and similar areas are being explored internationally.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/subsalt
subduction,"A plate tectonic process in which one lithospheric plate descends beneath another into the asthenosphere during a collision at a convergent plate margin. Because of the relatively higher density of oceanic lithosphere, it will typically descend beneath the lighter continental lithosphere during a collision. In a collision of plates of continental lithosphere, the density of the two plates is so similar that neither tends to be subducted and mountains form. As a subducted plate descends into the asthenosphere, Earthquakes can occur, especially in the Wadati-Benioff zone, but, if the plate descends deeply into the mantle, it will eventually be heated to the point of melting. Volcanoes can form above a descending plate.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/subduction
structure map,"A type of subsurface map whose contours represent the elevation of a particular formation, reservoir or geologic marker in space, such that folds, faults and other geologic structures are clearly displayed. Its appearance is similar to that of a topographic map, but a topographic map displays elevations of the Earth's surface and a structure map displays the elevation of a particular rock layer, generally beneath the surface.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/structure_map
sequence stratigraphy,"A field of study in which basin-filling sedimentary deposits, called sequences, are interpreted in a framework of eustasy, sedimentation and subsidence through time in order to correlate strata and predict the stratigraphy of relatively unknown areas. Sequences tend to show cyclicity of changes in relative sea level and widespread unconformities, processes of sedimentation and sources of sediments, climate and tectonic activity over time. Sequence stratigraphic study promotes thorough understanding of the evolution of basins, but also allows for interpretations of potential source rocks and reservoir rocks in both frontier areas (having seismic data but little well data) and in more mature hydrocarbon provinces. Prediction of reservoir continuity is currently a key question in mature hydrocarbon provinces where sequence stratigraphy is being applied.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sequence_stratigraphy
secondary migration,"The movement of generated hydrocarbons into a reservoir after their expulsion, or primary migration, from a source rock.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/secondary_migration

sedimentary,"One of the three main classes of rock (igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary). Sedimentary rocks are formed at the Earth's surface through deposition of sediments derived from weathered rocks, biogenic activity or precipitation from solution. Clastic sedimentary rocks such as conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones and shales form as older rocks weather and erode, and their particles accumulate and lithify, or harden, as they are compacted and cemented. Biogenic sedimentary rocks form as a result of activity by organisms, including coral reefs that become limestone. Precipitates, such as the evaporite minerals halite (salt) and gypsum can form vast thicknesses of rock as seawater evaporates. Sedimentary rocks can include a wide variety of minerals, but quartz, feldspar, calcite, dolomite and evaporite group and clay group minerals are most common because of their greater stability at the Earth's surface than many minerals that comprise igneous and metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary rocks, unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, can contain fossils because they form at temperatures and pressures that do not obliterate fossil remnants.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sedimentary
sediment,"The unconsolidated grains of minerals, organic matter or preexisting rocks, that can be transported by water, ice or wind, and deposited. The processes by which sediment forms and is transported occur at or near the surface of the Earth and at relatively low pressures and temperatures. Sedimentary rocks form from the accumulation and lithification of sediment. Sediments are classified according to size by the Udden-Wentworth scale.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sediment
seep,"A naturally occurring, typically slow leakage of fluid—water, oil or gas—at the Earth’s surface. A seep results from migration of the fluid from its source or reservoir formation because the formation pressure exceeds the formation’s seal capacity such as during rapid loading of the overburden by sedimentation or during fluid expansion or from damage to the seal such as by faulting or tectonism.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seep
systems tract,Subdivisions of sequences that consist of discrete depositional units that differ in geometry from other systems tracts and have distinct boundaries on seismic data. Different systems tracts are considered to represent different phases of eustatic changes. A lowstand systems tract develops during times of relatively low sea level; a highstand systems tract at times of high sea level; and a transgressive systems tract at times of changing sea level.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/systems_tract
sedimentation,"The process of creation, transportation and deposition of sediments.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sedimentation
subsidence,"The relative sinking of the Earth's surface. Plate tectonic activity (particularly extension of the crust, which promotes thinning and sinking), sediment loading and removal of fluid from reservoirs are processes by which the crust can be depressed. Subsidence can produce areas in which sediments accumulate and, ultimately, form sedimentary basins.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/subsidence

stratigraphic trap,"A variety of sealed geologic container capable of retaining hydrocarbons, formed by changes in rock type or pinch-outs, unconformities, or sedimentary features such as reefs. Structural traps, in contrast, consist of geologic structures in deformed strata such as faults and folds whose geometries permit retention of hydrocarbons.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stratigraphic_trap
strain,"The permanent deformation evident in rocks and other solid bodies that have experienced a sufficiently high applied stress. A change in shape, such as folding, faulting, fracturing, or change, generally a reduction, in volume are common examples of strain seen in rocks. Strain can be described in terms of normal and shear components, and is the ratio of the change in length or volume to the initial length or volume.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/strain
swamp,A wetland depositional environment in which water is present either permanently or intermittently and in which trees and large woody plants can grow but peat does not form. Swamps can contain considerable quantities of organic matter.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/swamp
synthetic fault,A type of minor fault whose sense of displacement is similar to its associated major fault. Antithetic-synthetic fault sets are typical in areas of normal faulting.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/synthetic_fault

The comparison, or correlation, of separated strata can include study of their lithology, fossil content, and relative or absolute age, or lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and chronostratigraphy.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stratigraphic_analysis
strata,Layers of sedimentary rock. The singular form is stratum.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/strata
sweet,Pertaining to crude oil or natural gas lacking appreciable amounts of sulfur or sulfur compounds.,Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sweet
superposition,"The stratigraphic principle that, in the case of undeformed, flat-lying strata, younger layers are deposited atop older ones, such that the top layer is youngest and underlying layers increase in age with depth. Nicolaus Steno articulated the law of superposition of strata in the 17th century.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/superposition
syncline,"Basin- or trough-shaped fold in rock in which rock layers are downwardly convex. The youngest rock layers form the core of the fold and outward from the core progressively older rocks occur. Synclines typically do not trap hydrocarbons because fluids tend to leak up the limbs of the fold. An anticline is the opposite type of fold, having upwardly-convex layers with old rocks in the core.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/syncline
sour,"Contaminated with sulfur or sulfur compounds, especially hydrogen sulfide. Crude oil and gas that are sour typically have an odor of rotten eggs if the concentration of sulfur is low. At high concentrations, sulfur is odorless and deadly.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sour
source rock,"A rock rich in organic matter which, if heated sufficiently, will generate oil or gas. Typical source rocks, usually shales or limestones, contain about 1% organic matter and at least 0.5% total organic carbon (TOC), although a rich source rock might have as much as 10% organic matter. Rocks of marine origin tend to be oil-prone, whereas terrestrial source rocks (such as coal) tend to be gas-prone. Preservation of organic matter without degradation is critical to creating a good source rock, and necessary for a complete petroleum system. Under the right conditions, source rocks may also be reservoir rocks, as in the case of shale gas reservoirs.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/source_rock
spill point,"The structurally lowest point in a hydrocarbon trap that can retain hydrocarbons. Once a trap has been filled to its spill point, further storage or retention of hydrocarbons will not occur for lack of reservoir space within that trap. The hydrocarbons spill or leak out, and they continue to migrate until they are trapped elsewhere.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spill_point
shaly,"Containing shale, a fine-grained, fissile, detrital sedimentary rock formed by consolidation of clay- and silt-sized particles into thin, relatively impermeable layers. It is the most abundant sedimentary rock. Shale can include relatively large amounts of organic material compared with other rock types and thus has potential to become a rich hydrocarbon source rock, even though a typical shale contains just 1% organic matter. Its typical fine grain size and lack of permeability, a consequence of the alignment of its platy or flaky grains, allow shale to form a good cap rock for hydrocarbon traps. Gas shows from shales during drilling have led some shales to be targeted as potential gas reservoirs. Various clay types and volumes influence the quality of the reservoir from a petrophysical and geomechanical perspective. The quality of shale reservoirs depends on their thickness and extent, organic content, thermal maturity, depth and pressure, fluid saturations, and permeability, among other factors.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shaly
siliciclastic sediment,"Silica-based, noncarbonaceous sediments that are broken from preexisting rocks, transported elsewhere, and redeposited before forming another rock. Examples of common siliciclastic sedimentary rocks include conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone and shale. Carbonate rocks can also be broken and reworked to form other types of clastic sedimentary rocks.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/siliciclastic_sediment
shelf,"Continental shelf, or the area at the edges of a continent from the shoreline to a depth of 200 m [660 ft], where the continental slope begins. The shelf is commonly a wide, flat area with a slight seaward slope. The term is sometimes used as a for platform.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shelf

shale oil,"Oil obtained by artificial maturation of oil shale. The process of artificial maturation uses controlled heating, or pyrolysis, of kerogen to release the shale oil.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shale_oil
shear strain,"The amount of deformation by shearing, in which parallel lines slide past each other in differing amounts. The measurement is expressed as the tangent of the change in angle between lines that were initially perpendicular.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shear_strain

sinistral,"Pertaining to a strike-slip or left-lateral fault in which the block across the fault moves to the left; also called a sinistral strike-slip fault. If it moves to the right, the relative motion is described as dextral. Counterclockwise rotation or spiraling is also described as sinistral.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sinistral

The quality of shale reservoirs depends on their thickness and extent, organic content, thermal maturity, depth and pressure, fluid saturations, and permeability, among other factors.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shale
scout ticket,"A brief report about a well from the time it is permitted through drilling and completion. A scout ticket typically includes the location, total depth, logs run, production status and formation tops.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/scout_ticket
scout,To inspect an area or to monitor activity.,vt.,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/scout
similar fold,"A type of fold in which the thickness of the layers remains constant when measured parallel to the axial surface and the layers have the same wave shape, but the thickness along each layer varies. The folded layers tend to be thicker in the hinge of the fold and thinner along the limbs of the fold.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/similar_fold
saturation,"The relative amount of water, oil and gas in the pores of a rock, usually as a percentage of volume.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/saturation
sabkha,"An environment of coastal sedimentation characterized by arid or semiarid conditions above the level of high tide and by the absence of vegetation. Evaporites, eolian deposits and tidal-flood deposits are common in sabkhas.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sabkha
salt dome,"A mushroom-shaped or plug-shaped diapir made of salt, commonly having an overlying cap rock. Salt domes form as a consequence of the relative buoyancy of salt when buried beneath other types of sediment. The salt flows upward to form salt domes, sheets, pillars and other structures. Hydrocarbons are commonly found around salt domes because of the abundance and variety of traps created by salt movement and the association with evaporite minerals that can provide excellent sealing capabilities.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/salt_dome
sandstone,"A clastic sedimentary rock whose grains are predominantly sand-sized. The term is commonly used to imply consolidated sand or a rock made of predominantly quartz sand, although sandstones often contain feldspar, rock fragments, mica and numerous additional mineral grains held together with silica or another type of cement. The relatively high porosity and permeability of sandstones make them good reservoir rocks.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sandstone
sand,A detrital grain between 0.0625 mm and 2 mm in diameter. Sand is larger than silt but smaller than a granule according to the Udden-Wentworth scale. Sand is also a term used for quartz grains or for sandstone.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sand
s.g.,The dimensionless ratio of the density of a material to that of the same volume of water. Most common minerals have specific gravities between 2 and 7.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sg
salt,"[NaCl] A soft, soluble evaporite mineral also known as halite or rock salt. Because salt is less dense than many sedimentary rocks, it is relatively buoyant and can form salt domes, pillars or curtains by flowing and breaking through or piercing overlying sediments, as seen in the Gulf of Mexico and the Zagros fold belt. Halite can be critical in forming hydrocarbon traps and seals because it tends to flow rather than fracture during deformation, thus preventing hydrocarbons from leaking out of a trap even during and after some types of deformation.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/salt
seismite,An injectite attributable to earthquake or seismic shaking.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seismite
sequence,A group of relatively conformable strata that represents a cycle of deposition and is bounded by unconformities or correlative conformities. Sequences are the fundamental unit of interpretation in sequence stratigraphy. Sequences comprise systems tracts.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sequence
sequence boundary,"A surface that separates older sequences from younger ones, commonly an unconformity (indicating subaerial exposure), but in limited cases a correlative conformable surface. A sequence boundary is an erosional surface that separates cycles of deposition.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sequence_boundary
specific gravity,The dimensionless ratio of the density of a material to that of the same volume of water. Most common minerals have specific gravities between 2 and 7.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/specific_gravity
sorting,"The range of sedimentary grain sizes that occurs in sediment or sedimentary rock. The term also refers to the process by which sediments of similar size are naturally segregated during transport and deposition according to the velocity and transporting medium. Well-sorted sediments are of similar size (such as desert sand), while poorly-sorted sediments have a wide range of grain sizes (as in a glacial till). A well-sorted sandstone tends to have greater porosity than a poorly sorted sandstone because of the lack of grains small enough to fill its pores. Conglomerates tend to be poorly sorted rocks, with particles ranging from boulder size to clay size.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sorting
soft rock,"A general term for sedimentary rocks, although it can imply a distinction between rocks of interest to the petroleum industry and rocks of interest to the mining industry.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/soft_rock
reservoir,A subsurface body of rock having sufficient porosity and permeability to store and transmit fluids. Sedimentary rocks are the most common reservoir rocks because they have more porosity than most igneous and metamorphic rocks and form under temperature conditions at which hydrocarbons can be preserved. A reservoir is a critical component of a complete petroleum system.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reservoir
production,The phase that occurs after successful exploration and development and during which hydrocarbons are drained from an oil or gas field.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/production
reservoir pressure,"The pressure of fluids within the pores of a reservoir, usually hydrostatic pressure, or the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level. When impermeable rocks such as shales form as sediments are compacted, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to anomalously high formation pressures. Because reservoir pressure changes as fluids are produced from a reservoir, the pressure should be described as measured at a specific time, such as initial reservoir pressure.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reservoir_pressure
closure,The vertical distance from the apex of a structure to the lowest structural contour that contains the structure. Measurements of both the areal closure and the distance from the apex to the lowest closing contour are typically incorporated in calculations of the estimated hydrocarbon content of a trap.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/closure
topographic map,A contour map that displays the elevation of the Earth's surface. A topographic map is commonly used as the base map for surface geological mapping.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/topographic_map
TOC,"The concentration of organic material in source rocks as represented by the weight percent of organic carbon. A value of approximately 0.5% total organic carbon by weight percent is considered the minimum for an effective source rock, although values of 2% are considered the minimum for shale gas reservoirs; values exceeding 10% exist, although some geoscientists assert that high total organic carbon values indicate the possibility of kerogen filling pore space rather than other forms of hydrocarbons. Total organic carbon is measured from 1-g samples of pulverized rock that are combusted and converted to CO or CO2. If a sample appears to contain sufficient total organic carbon to generate hydrocarbons, it may be subjected to pyrolysis.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/toc
transpression,"The simultaneous occurrence of strike-slip faulting and compression, or convergence, of the Earth's crust. In areas of transpression, rocks can be faulted upward to form a positive flower structure. Areas of strike-slip faulting in rifting or diverging crust are experiencing transtension, in which rocks can drop down to form a negative flower structure.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transpression
trap,"A configuration of rocks suitable for containing hydrocarbons and sealed by a relatively impermeable formation through which hydrocarbons will not migrate. Traps are described as structural traps (in deformed strata such as folds and faults) or stratigraphic traps (in areas where rock types change, such as unconformities, pinch-outs and reefs). A trap is an essential component of a petroleum system.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/trap
transtension,"The simultaneous occurrence of strike-slip faulting and extension, rifting, or divergence of the Earth's crust. In areas of transtension, rocks can be faulted downward to form a negative flower structure.

A transgression can result in sediments characteristic of shallow water being overlain by deeper water sediments.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transgressive
tadpole,"A symbol plotted on a dipmeter log used to indicate dip angle and direction. The symbol, named for its resemblance to a tadpole (a toad in its larval stage of development) consists of a circle with a short line (or tail) extending from it. A solid black dot shows good data, while an open circle indicates a less reliable measurement. The circular part of the tadpole is plotted against depth on the y-axis and dip magnitude is on the x-axis. The tail extends in the azimuthal direction of dip; the azimuth measurement is displayed with north or 0° being up, east or 90° at right, south or 180°is down and west or 270° is left.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tadpole

temperature gradient,"Also known as geothermal gradient, the rate of increase in temperature per unit depth in the Earth. Although the geothermal gradient varies from place to place, it averages 25 to 30 °C/km [15 °F/1000 ft]. Temperature gradients sometimes increase dramatically around volcanic areas. It is particularly important for drilling fluids engineers to know the geothermal gradient in an area when they are designing a deep well. The downhole temperature can be calculated by adding the surface temperature to the product of the depth and the geothermal gradient.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/temperature_gradient
tectonics,"Also known as plate tectonics, the unifying geologic theory developed to explain observations that interactions of the brittle plates of the lithosphere with each other and with the softer underlying asthenosphere result in large-scale changes in the Earth. The theory of plate tectonics initially stemmed from observations of the shapes of the continents, particularly South America and Africa, which fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle and have similar rocks and fossils despite being separated by a modern ocean. As lithospheric plates heat up or cool down depending on their position, or their tectonic environment, relative to each other and to warmer areas deeper within the Earth, they become relatively more or less dense than the asthenosphere and thus tend to rise as molten magma or sink in cold, brittle slabs or slide past each other. Mountain belts can form during plate collisions or an orogeny; diverging plates or rifts can create new midoceanic ridges; plates that slide past one another create transform fault zones (such as the San Andreas fault); and zones of subduction occur where one lithospheric plate moves beneath another. Plate tectonic theory can explain such phenomena as earthquakes, volcanic or other igneous activity, midoceanic ridges and the relative youth of the oceanic crust, and the formation of sedimentary basins on the basis of their relationships to lithospheric plate boundaries. Convection of the mantle is postulated to be the driving mechanism for the movement of lithospheric plates. Measurements of the continents using the Global Positioning System confirm the relative motions of plates. Age determinations of the oceanic crust confirm that such crust is much younger than that of the continents and has been recycled by the process of subduction and regenerated at midoceanic ridges.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tectonics
true stratigraphic thickness,The thickness of a bed or rock body after correcting for the dip of the bed or body and the deviation of the well that penetrates it. The values of true stratigraphic thickness in an area can be plotted and contours drawn to create an isopach map.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/true_stratigraphic_thickness

true dip,"The maximum angle that a bedding plane, fault plane or other geological surface declines away from a horizontal plane measured in a vertical plane that is perpendicular to the strike of the structure. Any measurement obtained at an angle not perpendicular to strike will yield an apparent dip, which is always less than the maximum angle of declination that is obtained when measuring perpendicular to formation strike.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/true_dip
tuff,Lithified volcanic ash.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tuff
turbidity current,"An influx of rapidly moving, sediment-laden water down a slope into a larger body of water; also called a density current because the suspended sediment results in the current having a higher density than the clearer water into which it flows. Such currents can occur in lakes and oceans, in some cases as by-products of earthquakes or mass movements such as slumps. The sedimentary deposits that form as the current loses energy are called turbidites and can be preserved as Bouma sequences. Turbidity currents are characteristic of trench slopes of convergent plate margins and continental slopes of passive margins.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/turbidity_current
tortuosity,"A measure of the geometric complexity of a porous medium. Tortuosity is a ratio that characterizes the convoluted pathways of fluid diffusion and electrical conduction through porous media. In the fluid mechanics of porous media, tortuosity is the ratio of the length of a streamline—a flow line or path—between two points to the straight-line distance between those points. Tortuosity is thus related to the ratio of a fluid's diffusion coefficient when it is not confined by a porous medium to its effective diffusion coefficient when confined in a porous medium. Tortuosity is also related to the formation factor, which is the ratio of electrical resistivity of a conductive fluid in a porous medium to the electrical resistivity of the fluid itself.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tortuosity
tuffaceaous,"Containing tuff, which is lithified volcanic ash.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tuffaceaous
turbidite,"Sedimentary deposits formed by turbidity currents in deep water at the base of the continental slope and on the abyssal plain. Turbidites commonly show predictable changes in bedding from coarse layers at the bottom to finer laminations at the top, known as Bouma sequences, that result from different settling velocities of the particle sizes present. The high energy associated with turbidite deposition can result in destruction of earlier deposited layers by subsequent turbidity currents.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/turbidite
tight,"Describing a relatively impermeable reservoir rock from which hydrocarbon production is difficult. Reservoirs can be tight because of smaller grains or matrix between larger grains, or they might be tight because they consist predominantly of silt- or clay-sized grains, as is the case for shale reservoirs. Stimulation of tight formations can result in increased production from formations that previously would have been abandoned or produced uneconomically.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tight
tight oil,Oil found in relatively impermeable reservoir rock. Production of tight oil comes from very low permeability rock that must be stimulated using hydraulic fracturing to create sufficient permeability to allow the mature oil and/or natural gas liquids to flow at economic rates.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tight_oil
tight gas,Gas produced from a relatively impermeable reservoir rock. Hydrocarbon production from tight reservoirs can be difficult without stimulation operations.

The term is generally used for reservoirs other than shales.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tight_gas
thermal gradient,"Also known as geothermal gradient, the rate of increase in temperature per unit depth in the Earth. Although the geothermal gradient varies from place to place, it averages 25 to 30 °C/km [15 °F/1000 ft]. Temperature gradients sometimes increase dramatically around volcanic areas. It is particularly important for drilling fluids engineers to know the geothermal gradient in an area when they are designing a deep well. The downhole temperature can be calculated by adding the surface temperature to the product of the depth and the geothermal gradient.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thermal_gradient

metamorphism,"The process by which the characteristics of rocks are altered or the rock is recrystallized. Metamorphism of igneous, sedimentary, or preexisting metamorphic rock can produce new metamorphic rock. Such alteration occurs as rocks respond to changes in temperatures, pressures and fluids, commonly along the edges of colliding lithospheric plates. The pressures and temperatures at which metamorphism occurs are higher than those of diagenesis, but no clear boundary between the two has been established.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/metamorphism
metamorphic,"One of three main classes of rock (igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary). Metamorphic rocks form from the alteration of preexisting rocks by changes in ambient temperature, pressure, volatile content, or all of these. Such changes can occur through the activity of fluids in the Earth and movement of igneous bodies or regional tectonic activity. The texture of metamorphic rocks can vary from almost homogeneous, or nonfoliated, to foliated rocks with a strong planar fabric or foliation produced by alignment of minerals during recrystallization or by reorientation. Common foliated metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist and slate. Marble, or metamorphosed limestone, can be foliated or non-foliated. Hornfels is a nonfoliated metamorphic rock. Graphite, chlorite, talc, mica, garnet and staurolite are distinctive metamorphic minerals.",Adjective,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/metamorphic
Milankovitch cycles,"The variation of the Earth's exposure to the sun's rays, or insolation, that results from variations in the orbit of the Earth and the tilt of its axis, and that might affect climate, sea level and sedimentation. Such variations are thought to occur in distinct time periods on the order of thousands of years. Ice ages might be a consequence of Milankovitch cycles.

More generally, hydrates are compounds in which gas molecules are trapped within a crystal structure. Hydrates form in cold climates, such as permafrost zones and in deep water. To date, economic liberation of hydrocarbon gases from hydrates has not occurred, but hydrates contain quantities of hydrocarbons that could be of great economic significance. Hydrates can affect seismic data by creating a reflection or multiple.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/methane_hydrate
migration,"The movement of hydrocarbons from their source into reservoir rocks. The movement of newly generated hydrocarbons out of their source rock is primary migration, also called expulsion. The further movement of the hydrocarbons into reservoir rock in a hydrocarbon trap or other area of accumulation is secondary migration.

The most prominent midoceanic ridges are those of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The new crust is made of mafic igneous rock called basalt, commonly referred to as midocean ridge basalt, or MORB, whose composition reflects that of the deeper mantle of the Earth. The presence of the spreading plate boundaries of the midoceanic ridges; their symmetrically spreading, successively older crust outward from the ridge; and the lack of oceanic crust older than approximately 200 Ma support the theory of plate tectonics and the recycling of oceanic crust through the process of subduction.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/midoceanic_ridge
mafic,"Pertaining to minerals or igneous rocks composed of minerals that are rich in iron and magnesium, dense, and typically dark in color. The term comes from the words magnesium and ferric.
