equation of state,"An equation that specifies fluid density as a function of pressure and temperature. A large body of scientific literature describes these functions for all kinds of hydrocarbons, and also for complex mixes of various hydrocarbons with other hydrocarbons and with other fluids. Once the components of a reservoir fluid are determined, the known hydrocarbon properties become a valuable tool in making further calculations of well-test results and predictions of future well and reservoir behavior.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/equation_of_state
early time transient data,"The data observed before the start of radial flow (middle-time transient data). When not dominated by wellbore storage, these data may reveal near-wellbore reservoir features including limited entry, hydraulic fracture, and dual-porosity or layering effects.

final flow rate,The production rate just prior to shut-in for a buildup test.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/final_flow_rate
final shut-in period,"The final buildup sequence in a drillstem test. The initial shut-in period is usually followed immediately by an extended period of flow.

final flowing pressure,The pressure determined at the formation face just prior to shut-in for a buildup test. This value is required to determine the skin effect.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/final_flowing_pressure
falloff test,"The measurement and analysis of pressure data taken after an injection well is shut in. These data are often the easiest transient well-test data to obtain. Wellhead pressure rises during injection, and if the well remains full of liquid after shut-in of an injector, the pressure can be measured at the surface, and bottomhole pressures can be calculated by adding the pressure from the hydrostatic column to the wellhead pressure. Since most water-injection wells are fractured during injection, and injection wells often go on vacuum, the fluid level can fall below the surface. Dealing with this complication requires reverting to bottomhole pressure gauges or sonic devices.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/falloff_test
fracturing pressure, Pressure above which injection of fluids will cause the rock formation to fracture hydraulically.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracturing_pressure
fractured-well analysis,"Analysis of a well that passes through a natural fracture or that has been hydraulically fractured. The fracture is treated as a slab of high permeability that is an effective extension of the actual wellbore. Flow is from the reservoir to the fracture and through the fracture to the well. The pressure-transient analysis for a fractured well can determine the fracture half-length and the fracture conductivity, as well as a fracture-face skin. The skin factor for the fracture is negative and usually ranges from -1.5 to -5, with an absolute minimum of -6 in rare cases. For effectively infinite-conductivity fractures, the apparent wellbore radius is half the fracture half-length, or xf/2.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fractured-well_analysis

free gas,The gaseous phase present in a reservoir or other contained area. Gas may be found either dissolved in reservoir fluids or as free gas that tends to form a gas cap beneath the top seal on the reservoir trap. Both free gas and dissolved gas play important roles in the reservoir-drive mechanism.,Noun,"Geology, Shale Gas",https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/free_gas
flow period,"Part of a well test when the well is flowing. It is usually specified prior to tests to ensure that a stable flow situation has been reached, or that the pressure disturbance has reached far enough into the formation to allow determination of a representative value for kh, or that any nearby boundaries could be recognized in a subsequent buildup.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_period

flow efficiency,The value that results when the actual productivity index is divided by the productivity index predicted from Darcy's law. Flow efficiency is greater than 1 in a stimulated well (skin < 0) and less than 1 for a damaged completion (skin > 0).,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_efficiency
formation fracture pressure,Pressure above which injection of fluids will cause the rock formation to fracture hydraulically.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_fracture_pressure
flow regime,"The predominant flow geometry reflected in a pressure-transient response that is most easily recognized in the log-log presentation of the pressure-change derivative. The most easily recognized flow regime is radial flow, which produces a constant or flat derivative. Spherical flow, which may result from a limited-entry completion, has a characteristic -1/2 slope in the derivative. Wellbore storage starts as a unit slope in pressure change and then the derivative bends over in a characteristic hump shape. Linear flow produced by flow to a fracture or a long horizontal well has a derivative slope of +1/2. Bilinear flow results when the fracture has finite conductivity and has a derivative slope of +1/4.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_regime

GOR,"Abbreviation for gas/oil ratio, the ratio of produced gas to produced oil.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gor
homogeneous formation,"Formation with rock properties that do not change with location in the reservoir. This ideal never actually occurs, but many formations are close enough to this situation that they can be considered homogeneous. Most of the models used for pressure-transient analysis assume the reservoir is homogeneous.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/homogeneous_formation
Horner slope,"The slope of the chosen straight-line section of a Horner plot. It is used to determine permeability thickness, kh, of the producing zone in the vicinity of the wellbore.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/horner_slope
hydrogen sulfide,"[H2S] An extraordinarily poisonous gas with a molecular formula of H2S. At low concentrations, H2S has the odor of rotten eggs, but at higher, lethal concentrations, it is odorless. H2S is hazardous to workers and a few seconds of exposure at relatively low concentrations can be lethal, but exposure to lower concentrations can also be harmful. The effect of H2S depends on duration, frequency and intensity of exposure as well as the susceptibility of the individual. Hydrogen sulfide is a serious and potentially lethal hazard, so awareness, detection and monitoring of H2S is essential. Since hydrogen sulfide gas is present in some subsurface formations, drilling and other operational crews must be prepared to use detection equipment, personal protective equipment, proper training and contingency procedures in H2S-prone areas. Hydrogen sulfide is produced during the decomposition of organic matter and occurs with hydrocarbons in some areas. It enters drilling mud from subsurface formations and can also be generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria in stored muds. H2S can cause sulfide-stress-corrosion cracking of metals. Because it is corrosive, H2S production may require costly special production equipment such as stainless steel tubing. Sulfides can be precipitated harmlessly from water muds or oil muds by treatments with the proper sulfide scavenger. H2S is a weak acid, donating two hydrogen ions in neutralization reactions, forming HS- and S-2 ions. In water or water-base muds, the three sulfide species, H2S and HS- and S-2 ions, are in dynamic equilibrium with water and H+ and OH- ions. The percent distribution among the three sulfide species depends on pH. H2S is dominant at low pH, the HS- ion is dominant at mid-range pH and S2 ions dominate at high pH. In this equilibrium situation, sulfide ions revert to H2S if pH falls. Sulfides in water mud and oil mud can be quantitatively measured with the Garrett Gas Train according to procedures set by API.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrogen_sulfide
humping,"The abnormal behavior in a buildup curve caused by phase redistribution in a wellbore. This behavior is most noticeable in oil wells producing a substantial amount of gas and having a substantial skin effect. Analysis of buildup curves for wells exhibiting this behavior can be difficult or impossible because the ""hump"" obscures the reservoir response.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/humping
heterogeneous formation,Formation with rock properties changing with location in the reservoir. Some naturally fractured reservoirs are heterogeneous formations.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/heterogeneous_formation
hammer union,A connection common in the oil industry consisting of two joints coupled by a threaded nut. Protrusions on the nut are hit with a sledgehammer to tighten the connection and energize the seals. Hammer unions are commonly used on treating iron because of their ability to be quickly made up or broken down.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hammer_union
bilinear flow,A flow regime resulting from combined simultaneous linear flow in perpendicular directions. This flow regime is seen most commonly in tests of hydraulically fractured wells and occurs for finite-conductivity fracture where linear flow exists both in the fracture and to the fracture plane. This flow regime is recognized as a 1/4 slope in the pressure derivative on the log-log diagnostic plot. Its presence enables determination of the fracture conductivity.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bilinear_flow
backflow,"Fluid flow in the borehole from one zone into another in response to pressure differences between the zones. Any time the wellbore pressure rises above the average pressure in any zone, backflow will occur. Analysis of buildup tests involving backflow is either impossible or extremely difficult and usually requires expert input to determine useful information from such tests.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/backflow
back flow,"Fluid flow in the borehole from one zone into another in response to pressure differences between the zones. Any time the wellbore pressure rises above the average pressure in any zone, backflow will occur. Analysis of buildup tests involving backflow is either impossible or extremely difficult and usually requires expert input to determine useful information from such tests.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/back_flow
bubblepoint,"The pressure and temperature conditions at which the first bubble of gas comes out of solution in oil. At discovery, all petroleum reservoir oils contain some natural gas in solution. Often the oil is saturated with gas when discovered, meaning that the oil is holding all the gas it can at the reservoir temperature and pressure, and that it is at its bubblepoint. Occasionally, the oil will be undersaturated. In this case, as the pressure is lowered, the pressure at which the first gas begins to evolve from the oil is defined as the bubblepoint.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bubblepoint
buildup test,"The measurement and analysis of (usually) bottomhole pressure data acquired after a producing well is shut in. Buildup tests are the preferred means to determine well flow capacity, permeability thickness, skin effect, and other information. Soon after a well is shut in, the fluid in the wellbore usually reaches a somewhat quiescent state in which bottomhole pressure rises smoothly and is easily measured. This allows interpretable test results.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/buildup_test
boundary conditions,The flux (flow rate) or pressure states assigned to the theoretical boundaries used in developing and solving the differential equations that apply to well testing and in specifying a model to match to pressure-transient data.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/boundary_conditions
bounded reservoir,Reservoirs with sealed or apparent outer boundaries that result in pressure depletion. Mathematical treatments differ between bounded and infinite reservoirs.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bounded_reservoir
bottomhole shut-in,A well shut in slightly above the producing formation by use of special downhole tools containing a valve that can be preprogrammed or controlled from the surface. This practice is commonly associated with drillstem tests. Technology exists to employ bottomhole shut-in in suitably equipped completed wells.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bottomhole_shut-in
bottomhole pressure,"The pressure, usually measured in pounds per square inch (psi), at the bottom of the hole. This pressure may be calculated in a static, fluid-filled wellbore with the equation:

BHP = MW * Depth * 0.052

where",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bottomhole_pressure
closed-in well,A well with a valve closed to halt production. Wells are often closed in for a period of time to allow stabilization prior to beginning a drawdown-buildup test sequence.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/closed-in_well
convolution,"A mathematical operation on two functions that is the most general representation of the process of linear (invariant) filtering. Convolution can be applied to any two functions of time or space (or other variables) to yield a third function, the output of the convolution. Although the mathematical definition is symmetric with respect to the two input functions, it is common in signal processing to say that one of the functions is a filter acting on the other function. The response of many physical systems can be represented mathematically by a convolution. For example, a convolution can be used to model the filtering of seismic energy by the various rock layers in the Earth; deconvolution is used extensively in seismic processing to counteract that filtering.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/convolution
convolve,"To perform a convolution, which is a mathematical operation on two functions that is the most general representation of the process of linear (invariant) filtering.

correcting pressure to a datum,"A procedure for correcting pressure measurements in a reservoir to a common datum level. This is not required for calculating kh, permeability thickness, and s, skin effect, but is required for determining average reservoir pressures or for any comparison of pressures in one area of the reservoir to those in another area. The correction is done by determining the average pressure for a given well test in which the pressure gauge is at a known level, and then adding or subtracting the calculated weight of the column of reservoir fluid in pounds per square inch from the difference in elevation between the pressure gauge and the datum level.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/correcting_pressure_to_a_datum
closed-chamber testing,"A type of drillstem testing conducted with the drillstring in the hole and the surface valve closed to create a closed chamber of known volume into which the reservoir fluid can flow. The drillstring is sometimes filled with nitrogen at a relatively low pressure prior to testing. When the well begins to flow, the nitrogen or air is compressed and the volume of fluid inflow can be calculated as a function of time by monitoring the surface pressure in the drillstring. The bottomhole valve is closed to halt flow when the surface pressure reaches a value calculated prior to testing. This ensures that a precisely known amount of production has taken place.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/closed-chamber_testing
cushion,A fluid column (usually water or nitrogen) put in the drillstem to provide the desired backpressure at the start of a drillstem test. The cushion usually serves to limit the differential pressure across the test string and packer to avoid flow below the bubblepoint pressure (in which case water is the usual cushion) or to enable a depleted reservoir to flow (nitrogen is the likely cushion).,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cushion
continuity equation,Material balance expressed in a differential equation.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/continuity_equation
commercial rate,"A rate, or production volume, sufficient to satisfy project economics.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/commercial_rate
commingled completion,A wellbore completed in two or more reservoir zones that are not in hydraulic communication in the reservoir. Backflow (often incorrectly referred to as crossflow) is common during rate cutbacks and buildup tests on these types of completions. Analysis of buildup data acquired from a commingled completion can be difficult or impossible.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/commingled_completion

Flow rates are never truly constant, but changes of only a few percent do not affect the results of well-test analysis appreciably if the rate is averaged over the flow period.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/constant_rate
compressibility,The ratio of the percent change in volume to the change in pressure applied to a fluid or rock.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/compressibility
condensate,"A low-density, high-API gravity liquid hydrocarbon phase that generally occurs in association with natural gas. Its presence as a liquid phase depends on temperature and pressure conditions in the reservoir allowing condensation of liquid from vapor. The production of condensate reservoirs can be complicated because of the pressure sensitivity of some condensates: During production, there is a risk of the condensate changing from gas to liquid if the reservoir pressure drops below the dew point during production. Reservoir pressure can be maintained by fluid injection if gas production is preferable to liquid production. Gas produced in association with condensate is called wet gas. The API gravity of condensate is typically 50 degrees to 120 degrees.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/condensate
diffusion equation,A partial differential equation describing the variation in space and time of a physical quantity that is governed by diffusion. The diffusion equation provides a good mathematical model for the variation of temperature through conduction of heat and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a highly conducting medium. The diffusion equation is a parabolic partial differential equation whose characteristic form relates the first partial derivative of a field with respect to time to its second partial derivatives with respect to spatial coordinates. It is closely related to the wave equation.,Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diffusion_equation
deconvolution,"A step in seismic signal processing to recover high frequencies, attenuate multiples, equalize amplitudes, produce a zero-phase wavelet or for other purposes that generally affect the waveshape. Deconvolution, or inverse filtering, can improve seismic data that were adversely affected by filtering, or convolution that occurs naturally as seismic energy is filtered by the Earth. Deconvolution can also be performed on other types of data, such as gravity, magnetic or well log data.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/deconvolution
Darcy units,"Units of atm, cm3/s, cP, and D, as originally used by Darcy in flow experiments.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/darcy_units
datum level,The depth to which pressures are corrected to adjust for differences in elevations at which pressure measurements are made in different wells or at different times.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/datum_level
dewpoint,"The pressure at which the first condensate liquid comes out of solution in a gas condensate. Many gas condensate reservoirs are saturated at initial conditions, meaning that the dewpoint is equal to the initial reservoir pressure. Condensate dissolution is called retrograde condensation because this is counter to the behavior of pure substances, which vaporize when the pressure drops below the saturation pressure under isothermal (constant temperature) conditions.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dewpoint
drillstem test,"A procedure to determine the productive capacity, pressure, permeability or extent (or a combination of these) of a hydrocarbon reservoir. While several different proprietary hardware sets are available to accomplish this, the common idea is to isolate the zone of interest with temporary packers. Next, one or more valves are opened to produce the reservoir fluids through the drillpipe and allow the well to flow for a time. Finally, the operator kills the well, closes the valves, removes the packers and trips the tools out of the hole. Depending on the requirements and goals for the test, it may be of short (one hour or less) or long (several days or weeks) duration and there might be more than one flow period and pressure buildup period.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/drillstem_test
depletion,"The drop in reservoir pressure or hydrocarbon reserves resulting from production of reservoir fluids. At times, a strong waterdrive will maintain reservoir pressure to a substantial degree so that reserves diminish without a corresponding pressure decline.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depletion
drawdown test,"The measurement and analysis of pressure data taken after a well is put on production, either initially or following an extended shut-in period. Drawdown data are usually noisy, meaning that the pressure moves up and down as fluid flows past the gauges and minute variations in flow rate take place. This is especially true for new wells, in which well cleanup commonly occurs for days after production has begun. Such data are difficult to interpret, and the noise often obscures regions of interest to the analyst. Transient downhole flow rates measured while flowing can be used to correct pressure variations through convolution or deconvolution calculations that enable diagnosis and interpretation, analogous to that done for the pressure change and derivative.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/drawdown_test
directional permeability,"Permeability that varies with direction of flow through the porous medium. Lateral permeability contrast can be particularly important in fractured formations, where effective permeability in the direction of the fractures may be many times greater than the matrix permeability. If the permeability in one direction is significantly more than in the other, the flow pattern may more closely approximate linear flow than radial flow. This can be detected from well-test data. Likewise, laminations in most clastic formations cause the permeability normal to the bedding plane to be less than the lateral permeability parallel to bedding. This is called vertical to horizontal permeability anisotropy.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/directional_permeability
drainage volume,"The portion of the volume of a reservoir drained by a well. In a reservoir drained by multiple wells, the volume ultimately drained by any given well is proportional to that well's production rate: Vi = Vt x qi/qt, where Vi is the drainage volume of Well i, Vt is the entire drainage volume of the reservoir, qi is the production rate from Well i, and qt is the total production rate from the reservoir.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/drainage_volume
DST,"Well tests conducted with the drillstring still in the hole. Often referred to as DST, these tests are usually conducted with a downhole shut-in tool that allows the well to be opened and closed at the bottom of the hole with a surface-actuated valve. One or more pressure gauges are customarily mounted into the DST tool and are read and interpreted after the test is completed. The tool includes a surface-actuated packer that can isolate the formation from the annulus between the drillstring and the casing, thereby forcing any produced fluids to enter only the drillstring. By closing in the well at the bottom, afterflow is minimized and analysis is simplified, especially for formations with low flow rates. The drillstring is sometimes filled with an inert gas, usually nitrogen, for these tests. With low-permeability formations, or where the production is mostly water and the formation pressure is too low to lift water to the surface, surface production may never be observed. In these cases, the volume of fluids produced into the drillstring is calculated and an analysis can be made without obtaining surface production. Occasionally, operators may wish to avoid surface production entirely for safety or environmental reasons, and produce only that amount that can be contained in the drillstring. This is accomplished by closing the surface valve when the bottomhole valve is opened. These tests are called closed-chamber tests.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dst
dual-permeability reservoir,A dual-porosity reservoir in which flow to the well occurs in both primary and secondary porosity systems.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dual-permeability_reservoir
DST pressure chart,"The characteristic plot of pressure versus time obtained from the mechanical recording of pressure gauges in a DST tool. Pressure rises as the tool is lowered into the hole and the hydrostatic head above the tool increases. The pressure stabilizes when the tool reaches bottom and then moves when the packer is set. Pressure drops immediately upon opening of the downhole valve to match the pressure in the drillstring, and then rises as fluid flows into the string. When the downhole valve is closed, the pressure buildup period begins immediately and continues until the valve is closed again.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dst_pressure_chart
dual completion,"A single wellbore having tubulars and equipment that enable production from two segregated zones. In most cases, two tubing strings will be used to provide the necessary level of control and safety for the fluids from both zones. However, in some simple dual completions, the second or upper zone is produced up the tubing-casing annulus.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dual_completion
dual-porosity reservoir,"A rock characterized by primary porosity from original deposition and secondary porosity from some other mechanism, and in which all flow to the well effectively occurs in one porosity system, and most of the fluid is stored in the other. Naturally fractured reservoirs and vugular carbonates are classified as dual-porosity reservoirs, as are layered reservoirs with extreme contrasts between high-permeability and low-permeability layers.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dual-porosity_reservoir
drainage area,"The reservoir area or volume drained by the well. The terms drainage area, reservoir area, and drainage volume are often incorrectly used interchangeably. When several wells drain the same reservoir, each drains its own drainage area, a subset of the reservoir area.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/drainage_area
rate-dependent skin effect," Skin effect with a magnitude that depends on the flow rate of the wellbore fluid. It is caused by non-Darcy flow, fluid flow that deviates from Darcy's law, which assumes laminar flow in the formation. Non-Darcy flow is typically observed in high-rate gas wells when the flow converging to the wellbore reaches flow velocities exceeding the Reynolds number for laminar or Darcy flow, and results in turbulent flow. Since most of the turbulent flow takes place near the wellbore in producing formations, the effect of non-Darcy flow is a rate-dependent skin effect.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/rate-dependent_skin_effect
radius of investigation,"A distance that characterizes how far a logging tool measures into the formation from the axis of the tool or borehole. The term is similar to depth of investigation, but is more appropriate for certain azimuthally symmetric measurements, mainly resistivity. The radius of investigation summarizes the radial response of the measurement in one or more distances, and should be associated with the percentage of signal received from within that depth, typically either 50% or 90%. Most quoted depths of investigation assume a homogeneous formation with certain properties, such as a given resistivity or fluid content. The radius of investigation can vary considerably in inhomogeneous conditions, and at different values of the properties concerned. It should be considered only a qualitative guide to tool response.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/radius_of_investigation
reservoir heterogeneities,"The variations in rock properties in a reservoir. The variations can result in directional variations in permeability. Geological processes, such as sedimentation, diagenesis and erosion, act to produce nonuniformities in rock formations. Because there are so many types of reservoir heterogeneities, a unique interpretation of test results from pressure data alone is often impossible. Expert test interpreters rely heavily on experience, core analysis, well logs and knowledge of the geology specific to the region.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reservoir_heterogeneities
kh,"The product of formation permeability, k, and producing formation thickness, h, in a producing well, referred to as kh. This product is the primary finding of buildup and drawdown tests and is a key factor in the flow potential of a well. It is used for a large number of reservoir engineering calculations such as prediction of future performance, secondary and tertiary recovery potential, and potential success of well-stimulation procedures. Obtaining the best possible value of this product is the primary objective of transient well tests. To separate the elements of the product, it is necessary to have some independent measurement of one of them, usually the estimation of producing formation thickness from well logs. Permeability is then calculated, provided that the fluid formation volume factor and viscosity are known. The accuracy of the calculated permeability is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the estimated formation thickness and the fluid properties.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/k/kh
limited entry,"A completion with only a portion of the productive interval open to flow, either by design or as a result of damage. Limited-entry completions in vertical wells are designed to avoid unwanted fluid production, such as gas from an overlying gas cap or water from an underlying aquifer. The effects of limited entry may be seen in perforated and gravel-packed wells when some of the perforations fail to clean up. This is also called a partial completion. The limited entry also results from partial penetration, which occurs when the productive formation is only partly drilled. This partial penetration represents a near-well flow restriction that results in a positive skin effect in a well-test analysis.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/limited_entry
line source solution,"The solution to differential equations treating the well as a vertical line through a porous medium. The solution is nearly identical to the finite-wellbore solution. At very early times during a well test, there is a notable difference in the solutions, but the differences disappear soon after a typical well is opened to flow or shut in for a buildup test, and in practice the differences are masked by wellbore storage.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/line_source_solution

linear flow,"A flow regime characterized by parallel flow lines in the reservoir. This results from flow to a fracture or a long horizontal well, or from flow in an elongated reservoir, such as a fluvial channel, or as a formation bounded by parallel faults. Linear flow is recognized as a +1/2 slope in the pressure derivative on the log-log diagnostic plot. Its presence enables determination of the fracture half-length or the channel or reservoir width, if permeability can be determined independently.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/linear_flow
late-time transient data,The portion of the pressure transient occurring after radial flow. Analysis of the late-time transient data provides characterization of outer boundaries such as faults or fluid contacts. This portion of the data appears only in transient tests of sufficient duration.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/late-time_transient_data
layer,A slab of reservoir rock bounded above and below by another layer in vertical hydraulic communication.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/layer
layered reservoir testing,"An advanced testing technique using a combination of transient-rate and pressure measurements and stabilized flow profiles to determine permeability and skin for each of several layers commingled in a well. The technique requires a series of flow-rate changes, with at least one flow-rate change for each layer to be characterized.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/layered_reservoir_testing
liquid level,The depth at which the first liquid is found in a well.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/liquid_level
infinite acting radial flow,"Flow into the wellbore during a well test, from a reservoir with no apparent outer boundary limit affecting fluid flow during the test period, the direction of flow being perpendicular to the axis of the well. Unless an outer boundary, such as a nearby fault, is close to the wellbore, it usually takes a day or more for outer boundaries to affect well-test results. Since most tests are of relatively short duration, outer boundaries usually do not affect test results.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/infinite_acting_radial_flow
infinite-conductivity fracture,A planar crack penetrated by a well or propagated from a well by hydraulic fracturing with zero pressure drop in the fracture during production.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/infinite-conductivity_fracture
infinite-acting reservoir,"A reservoir with no apparent outer boundary limit affecting fluid flow during a test period. Unless an outer boundary, such as a nearby fault, is close to the wellbore, it usually takes a day or more for outer boundaries to affect well-test results. Since most tests are of relatively short duration, outer boundaries usually do not affect test results.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/infinite-acting_reservoir
initial flow period,"A short flow period at the beginning of a drillstem test. This period is followed immediately by a longer shut-in period to allow the pressure to closely approach initial reservoir pressure. The initial flow period is commonly 5 to 10 minutes, and the initial shut-in period is commonly 30 minutes to one hour. When plotted on a pressure buildup plot, extrapolation of the best straight line gives what is usually accepted as the best obtainable value of initial formation pressure.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/initial_flow_period
injection-well testing,"The testing of wells in which fluid is being injected into the reservoir. The most common type of test is a falloff test, in which injection is halted and the pressure decline is measured as a function of time. The most common situation is a waterflood. In many reservoirs, the formation pressure is high enough to maintain a full column of fluid in the wellbore and the pressure can be monitored at the surface. The bottomhole pressure is then calculated by adding the weight of the fluid column to the surface pressure. Gas-injection wells, although less common, lend themselves to similar testing. The rise in fluid pressure as a function of time while injection is taking place could theoretically be used also, but this type of approach is rarely used. The equations and theory for these tests are an exact mirror image of those for buildup and drawdown testing. Calculated results for these wells are usually good because the formations are commonly liquid-filled. Frequently water-injection wells are inadvertently fractured at some time in their life and consequently have a negative skin effect.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/injection-well_testing
image well,"A virtual well used to mathematically create the effect of a flow barrier. The pressure transient behavior both at the well and in the reservoir is identical for the following two cases: 1) a well near a barrier represented by a plane normal to the bedding, or 2) a well producing or injecting at the same rate as the tested well. In the second case, the effect is of a barrier bisecting the space between the two wells.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/image_well
ideal gas,"A gas defined by the fundamental equation of state, pV = nRT, where pressure, p, times volume, V, equals moles of gas, n, times gas constant, R, times temperature, T. The units are arbitrary and are accommodated by the value of the gas constant R, which is different for every set of units.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/ideal_gas
initial shut-in period,"The comparatively short shut-in period following the initial flow period of a drillstem test. This period is followed immediately by much longer flow and shut-in periods to allow the pressure to closely approach initial reservoir pressure. The initial flow period is commonly 5 to 10 minutes, and the initial shut-in period is commonly 30 minutes to one hour. When plotted on a pressure buildup plot, extrapolation of the best straight line gives what is usually accepted as the best obtainable value of initial formation pressure.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/initial_shut-in_period
initial reservoir pressure,"The reservoir pressure measured in a discovery well, usually referred to as pi. This value is necessary for many reservoir engineering calculations, such as reserve determination.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/initial_reservoir_pressure
impermeable barrier,"A single, impenetrable barrier to fluid flow in a reservoir that causes a change of a factor of two in the slope of buildup or drawdown curves. These are often observed in a normal test if the barrier is close (a few hundred feet or less) to the tested well. Most tests are not long enough to detect the presence of distant barriers. Two perpendicular barriers cause a change in the slope of a factor of four, and so forth, and models exist for a variety of geometries, typically for up to four barriers.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/impermeable_barrier
isotropic permeability,"Permeability that is the same in all directions. This never really occurs, but permeability along various directions of a formation is often close enough for calculation purposes.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/isotropic_permeability
isotropic formation,"A type of formation whose rock properties are the same in all directions. Although this never actually occurs, fluid flow in rocks approximates this situation closely enough to consider certain formations isotropic.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/isotropic_formation
isochronal test,"A multirate test designed as a series of drawdown and buildup sequences at different drawdown flow rates, with each drawdown of the same duration and each buildup reaching stabilization at the same pressure as at the start of the test. The purpose of the test is to determine well deliverability. This type of test is most commonly done in gas wells.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/isochronal_test
interference testing,"The pressure variation with time recorded in observation wells resulting from changes in rates in production or injection wells. In commercially viable reservoirs, it usually takes considerable time for production at one well to measurably affect the pressure at an adjacent well. Consequently, interference testing has been uncommon because of the cost and the difficulty in maintaining fixed flow rates over an extended time period. With the increasing number of permanent gauge installations, interference testing may become more common than in the past.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/interference_testing
naturally flowing well,A well in which the formation pressure is sufficient to produce oil at a commercial rate without requiring a pump. Most reservoirs are initially at pressures high enough to allow a well to flow naturally.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/naturally_flowing_well
nonideal gas,"A gas described by an equation of state of the form pV = znRT, where z is the gas deviation factor dependent on pressure, temperature and gas composition.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/nonideal_gas
non-Darcy flow,"Fluid flow that deviates from Darcy's law, which assumes laminar flow in the formation. Non-Darcy flow is typically observed in high-rate gas wells when the flow converging to the wellbore reaches flow velocities exceeding the Reynolds number for laminar or Darcy flow, and results in turbulent flow. Since most of the turbulent flow takes place near the wellbore in producing formations, the effect of non-Darcy flow is a rate-dependent skin effect.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/non-darcy_flow
oil formation volume factor,"Oil and dissolved gas volume at reservoir conditions divided by oil volume at standard conditions. Since most measurements of oil and gas production are made at the surface, and since the fluid flow takes place in the formation, volume factors are needed to convert measured surface volumes to reservoir conditions. Oil formation volume factors are almost always greater than 1.0 because the oil in the formation usually contains dissolved gas that comes out of solution in the wellbore with dropping pressure.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oil_formation_volume_factor
oil well,A producing well with oil as its primary commercial product. Oil wells almost always produce some gas and frequently produce water. Most oil wells eventually produce mostly gas or water.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oil_well
open-flow potential,"The calculated maximum flow rate that a system may provide in the absence of restrictions. The term may be qualified as relating to a specific zone, such as a perforated interval or be used in referring to the production capability of the well.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/open-flow_potential

The term may be qualified as relating to a specific zone, such as a perforated interval, or be used in referring to the production capability of the well.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/open_flow_potential
phase redistribution,"A pressure phenomenon caused in a wellbore by rise of gas and fall of liquids trapped in a wellbore after a surface shut-in. This phenomenon can cause a ""hump"" in the buildup curve, and frequently leads to incorrect analysis of buildup test results because the entire early portion of the transient is adversely affected by this pressure response.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/phase_redistribution
partial completion,Completion of or flow from less than the entire producing interval. This situation causes a near-well flow constriction that results in a positive skin effect in a well-test analysis.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/partial_completion
partial penetration,An incompletely drilled portion of the productive interval.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/partial_penetration
permeability,"The ability, or measurement of a rock's ability, to transmit fluids, typically measured in darcies or millidarcies. The term was basically defined by Henry Darcy, who showed that the common mathematics of heat transfer could be modified to adequately describe fluid flow in porous media. Formations that transmit fluids readily, such as sandstones, are described as permeable and tend to have many large, well-connected pores. Impermeable formations, such as shales and siltstones, tend to be finer grained or of a mixed grain size, with smaller, fewer, or less interconnected pores. Absolute permeability is the measurement of the permeability conducted when a single fluid, or phase, is present in the rock. Effective permeability is the ability to preferentially flow or transmit a particular fluid through a rock when other immiscible fluids are present in the reservoir (for example, effective permeability of gas in a gas-water reservoir). The relative saturations of the fluids as well as the nature of the reservoir affect the effective permeability. Relative permeability is the ratio of effective permeability of a particular fluid at a particular saturation to absolute permeability of that fluid at total saturation. If a single fluid is present in a rock, its relative permeability is 1.0. Calculation of relative permeability allows for comparison of the different abilities of fluids to flow in the presence of each other, since the presence of more than one fluid generally inhibits flow.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/permeability
permeability thickness,"The product of formation permeability, k, and producing formation thickness, h, in a producing well, referred to as kh. This product is the primary finding of buildup and drawdown tests and is a key factor in the flow potential of a well. It is used for a large number of reservoir engineering calculations such as prediction of future performance, secondary and tertiary recovery potential, and potential success of well-stimulation procedures. Obtaining the best possible value of this product is the primary objective of transient well tests. To separate the elements of the product, it is necessary to have some independent measurement of one of them, usually the estimation of producing formation thickness from well logs. Permeability is then calculated, provided that the fluid formation volume factor and viscosity are known. The accuracy of the calculated permeability is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the estimated formation thickness and the fluid properties.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/permeability_thickness
producing well,"A well producing fluids (gas, oil or water).",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/producing_well
production period,"The flow period before a buildup. The duration of the production period should be specified in the test design to assure that a stable flow situation is reached, and that the pressure disturbance has reached far enough into the formation to allow determination of a representative value for kh. For reservoir-limits testing, the production period must be long enough for the pressure disturbance to have reached the boundaries of interest.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/production_period
producing formation,"An underground rock formation from which oil, gas or water is produced. Any porous rock will contain fluids of some sort, and all rocks at considerable distance below the Earth's surface will initially be under pressure, often related to the hydrostatic column of ground waters above the reservoir. To produce, rocks must also have permeability, or the capacity to permit fluids to flow through them.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/producing_formation
pseudosteady state,"Behavior observed when a well reaches stabilized production from a limited drainage volume. For constant-rate production, under pseudosteady state, the difference between the flowing wellbore pressure and the average reservoir pressure in the drainage volume is constant, and the pressure drawdown is a linear function of time, resulting in a unit slope in the log-log pressure derivative. The late-time buildup pressure will level off to the average reservoir pressure if the buildup duration is sufficient long, resulting in a sudden drop in the log-log pressure derivative. Pressure depletion occurs with continued pseudosteady-state production.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pseudosteady_state
pumping well tests,"Testing that is accomplished by measuring pressure in the annulus, or by pulling the pump and running a pressure gauge in the hole. The preferred method is usually to measure the pressure in the annulus if no packer is present. This is best done by monitoring the rise in fluid level with an echo-sounding device and calculating the bottomhole pressure by assuming a fluid density. Several excellent devices and associated services are available. Any time a well is shut in gradually, as is the case for pumping wells, some kind of multirate analysis is usually required to obtain acceptable results.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pumping_well_tests
pumping well,"A well produced by use of some kind of downhole pump. Pumps are required when the formation pressure is not sufficient to allow flowing production of fluids at the desired or necessary rate. The performance of well tests on pumping wells is always complicated by the presence of the pump, which often must be removed to take downhole pressure measurements. Downhole pressure measurements in pumping wells are usually made by measuring the rise in liquid level in the well. This is often accomplished by sonic devices, like well sounders, that measure the response time of sound waves bounced off the downhole liquid surface. Most oil wells are eventually put on pumps as pressure declines during production. The exceptions are in strong waterdrive reservoirs or in settings where pressure maintenance by gas or water injection is sufficient to maintain a high reservoir pressure.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pumping_well
prorated well,A well in which the maximum production rate is fixed by law. These laws were developed by producing states primarily to control the market and avoid periodic price collapses.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/prorated_well
pseudopressure plot,"A plot of real gas pseudopressure (pseudopotential) m(p) versus time function used to analyze gas-well drawdown and buildup tests. The use of the real gas pseudopressure linearizes the diffusion equation for gas flow. This form enables rigorous analysis over all pressure ranges. The pressure-squared plot can be used for low pressure (p < ~2000 psi), and pressure can be used to analyze gas-well tests at high pressure (p > ~3000 psi).",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pseudopressure_plot
pressure transient analysis,"The analysis of pressure changes over time, especially those associated with small variations in the volume of fluid. In most well tests, a limited amount of fluid is allowed to flow from the formation being tested and the pressure at the formation monitored over time. Then, the well is closed and the pressure monitored while the fluid within the formation equilibrates. The analysis of these pressure changes can provide information on the size and shape of the formation as well as its ability to produce fluids.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure_transient_analysis
pore-pressure gradient,"The change in pore pressure per unit of depth, typically in units of psi/ft or kPa/m. Pressure increases predictably with depth in areas of normal pressure. The normal hydrostatic pressure gradient for freshwater is 0.433 psi/ft, or 9.792 kPa/m, and 0.465 psi/ft for water with 100,000 ppm total dissolved solids (a typical Gulf Coast water), or 10.516 kPa/m. Deviations from normal pressure are described as high or low pressure.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pore-pressure_gradient
porous medium,A rock or soil with interconnected pores that permit flow of fluids through the medium.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/porous_medium
pressure-drawdown analysis,"The analysis of pressure-transient behavior observed while the well is flowing. Results are generally much less accurate than those from pressure buildup tests because the bottomhole pressure fluctuates rapidly with even slight changes in the surface flow rate. Therefore, pressure buildup tests are much preferred, and analysis of drawdown test data is usually relegated to backup status unless the buildup data are flawed.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure-drawdown_analysis
pressure depletion,"The drop in average reservoir pressure from fluid production. All bounded reservoirs have pressure depletion (a drop in average reservoir pressure) associated with fluid production. Water influx counters this effect in reservoirs that are surrounded or underlain by aquifers. Likewise, the presence of a gas cap can slow pressure depletion.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure_depletion
pressure-squared plot,A plot of p2 versus time function used to analyze low-pressure gas-well drawdown and buildup tests. The square term arises from substituting a gas-law equation into the differential equations where required to account for fluid compressibility. This allows an approximation for the differential equations that approaches the linear form required to use the classical solutions of the diffusion equation.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure-squared_plot
pressure drawdown,"The differential pressure that drives fluids from the reservoir into the wellbore. The drawdown, and therefore the production rate, of a producing interval is typically controlled by surface chokes. Reservoir conditions, such as the tendency to produce sand, may limit the drawdown that may be safely applied during production before damage or unwanted sand production occurs.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure_drawdown
pressure falloff,The pressure decline after halting or reducing fluid injection in a well. Pressure falloff tests in injection wells are analogous to pressure buildup tests in production wells.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure_falloff
pressure gauge,"A device used to measure pressure. Many different types of pressure gauges have been developed for use in well testing over the years. For bottomhole pressure measurements, these include helical bourdon tube gauges, strain gauges, quartz crystal gauges and surface readout gauges. All have their roles, and are still in use. Digital memory gauges are popular at the moment, since the data can be printed out or input directly into a computer for immediate use. Proper use of the data often requires specific knowledge of the possible idiosyncrasies of the particular gauge used in a test.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure_gauge
pressure buildup,A rise in well pressure as a function of time observed after a well is shut in or after the production rate is reduced. Buildup pressures are normally measured at or near the bottom of the hole.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure_buildup
pressure gradient,"The change in pressure per unit of depth, typically in units of psi/ft or kPa/m. Pressure increases predictably with depth in areas of normal pressure. The normal hydrostatic pressure gradient for freshwater is 0.433 psi/ft, or 9.792 kPa/m, and 0.465 psi/ft for water with 100,000 ppm total dissolved solids (a typical Gulf Coast water), or 10.516 kPa/m. Deviations from normal pressure are described as high or low pressure.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure_gradient

unitized production,Pooled production from wells or a reservoir. The proceeds of this pooled production are distributed to the participants according to an agreed-upon formula.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/unitized_production
variable rate,"A condition that results when the flow rate varies appreciably during a test period. This can be contrasted to multirate conditions, which describe the step changes in rate demanded by certain test designs. The variable rates observed during drawdown can be measured by a flowmeter at the sandface level in the well. Elegant mathematical methods have been developed to analyze well tests conducted at variable rates. Although, from a practical standpoint, it is much more desirable to conduct constant-rate tests, in reality the only truly constant rate is zero. Sandface flow-rate measurements provide considerable information from drawdown data that cannot be learned from a buildup.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/variable_rate
water formation volume factor,"Water and dissolved gas volume at reservoir conditions divided by water volume at standard conditions. This value can often be neglected, since it is always close to 1.0.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/water_formation_volume_factor
water influx,"The replacement of produced fluids by formation water. Most petroleum reservoirs are underlain by water, and water influx into a reservoir almost always takes place at some rate when gas or oil is produced. Whether appreciable water is produced along with gas or oil depends on the proximity of the productive interval to the oil-water contact or gas-water contact and whether the well is coning (vertical well) or cresting (horizontal well).",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/water_influx
wireline formation tester,"A tool run on an electric logging cable that pushes a probe into the formation, which then allows production into a small closed chamber. The tool is primarily used to obtain formation pressures at chosen locations in an interval, and, with an accurate quartz gauge, permeability estimates may be obtained. Modern variations on this tool have been developed to acquire formation-fluid samples.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wireline_formation_tester
wireline formation test,"Test taken with a wireline formation tester. The wireline formation pressure measurement is acquired by inserting a probe into the borehole wall and performing a minidrawdown and buildup by withdrawing a small amount of formation fluid and then waiting for the pressure to build up to the formation pore pressure. This measurement can provide formation pressures along the borehole, thereby giving a measure of pressure with depth or along a horizontal borehole. The trend in formation pressure with depth provides a measure of the formation-fluid density, and a change in this trend may indicate a fluid contact. Abrupt changes in formation pressure measurements with depth indicate differential pressure depletion and demonstrate barriers to vertical flow. Lateral variation in formation pressure measurements along a horizontal well or in multiple vertical wells indicate reservoir heterogeneity.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wireline_formation_test
wellbore fill-up,"Following a surface shut-in, the flow into a well caused by the compressibility of the fluids in the wellbore. Most of the flow occurs from compression of gas in the wellbore. The practical result is that the sandface flow rate is not zero and, therefore, not constant. This gives rise to one form of the wellbore-storage effect.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wellbore_fill-up
wellbore damage,Any restriction to flow from near-well reductions in flow capacity. This damage is thought to result from reductions in near-well permeability caused by perforating debris or from the solids or mud filtrate invasion caused by the drilling process.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wellbore_damage
wellbore storage effects,"Distortions in the reservoir response due to wellbore storage. The characteristic trends are an early unit slope trend with pressure change and the derivative overlain on the log-log plot, followed by a ""hump"" in the pressure derivative that gradually disappears as reservoir trends become recognizable. Complex behavior in the wellbore, such as wellbore phase distribution, can result in a more complex transient trend. A crucial part of the transient analysis is to distinguish the effects of wellbore storage from the interpretable reservoir response.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wellbore_storage_effects
well production rate,The volume of produced fluid per unit of time.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_production_rate
well potential,"The flow rate at which a well is theoretically capable of producing. This is usually defined by a mathematical formula related to Darcy's law, often at maximum theoretical pressure drawdown. These theoretical rates were, and still are to some extent, used to set the production quota for an individual well in prorated or unitized production situations.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_potential
well interference,The change in pressure at one well caused by production from one or more other wells.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_interference
well flow rate,The well production or injection rate.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_flow_rate
well interference testing,"The pressure variation with time recorded in observation wells resulting from changes in rates in production or injection wells. In commercially viable reservoirs, it usually takes considerable time for production at one well to measurably affect the pressure at an adjacent well. Consequently, interference testing has been uncommon because of the cost and the difficulty in maintaining fixed flow rates over an extended time period. With the increasing number of permanent gauge installations, interference testing may become more common than in the past.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_interference_testing
well cleanup,"That period when drilling debris and fluids are still coming out of the formation and perforations. During this time, the skin effect is changing and any well-test results may reflect temporary obstruction to flow that will not be present in later tests.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_cleanup
annulus,"The space between two concentric objects, such as between the wellbore and casing or between casing and tubing, where fluid can flow. Pipe may consist of drill collars, drillpipe, casing, or tubing.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/annulus
afterflow,"The flow associated with wellbore storage following a surface shut-in. When a well is first shut in at the surface, flow from the formation into the bottom of the wellbore continues unabated until compression of the fluids in the wellbore causes the downhole pressure to rise. If the wellbore fluid is highly compressible and the well rate is low, the afterflow period can be long. Conversely, high-rate wells producing little gas have negligible afterflow periods.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/afterflow
adjusted flow time,The approximated flow time used for a well-test analysis when the flow rate varies before or during the test period. It is calculated as t = cumulative well production since the last extended shut-in period divided by the flow rate just before a well is shut in for a buildup test.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/adjusted_flow_time
average reservoir pressure,The pressure that would be obtained if all fluid motion ceases in a given volume of reservoir. It also is the pressure to which a well will ultimately rise if shut in for an infinite period.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/average_reservoir_pressure
anisotropic formation,A formation with directionally dependent properties. The most common directionally dependent properties are permeability and stress. Most formations have vertical to horizontal permeability anisotropy with vertical permeability being much less (often an order of magnitude less) than horizontal permeability. Bedding plane permeability anisotropy is common in the presence of natural fractures. Stress anisotropy is frequently greatest between overburden stress and horizontal stress in the bedding plane. Bedding plane stress contrasts are common in tectonically active regions. Permeability anisotropy can sometimes be related to stress anisotropy.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/anisotropic_formation
subsurface pressure,Any pressure measured in a well below the surface.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/subsurface_pressure
swivel flange,"A flange consisting of two parts�a hub and a ring. The hub contains the gasket profile, and the ring features the bolt-hole pattern. The ring can rotate around the hub for easier makeup. Once the bolts are tightened, the ring is compressed against the hub via a shoulder and secured in place.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/swivel_flange
superposition in space,A mathematical computation that accounts for production from multiple wells. Image wells are used to model the effect of impermeable barriers.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/superposition_in_space
superposition,"The stratigraphic principle that, in the case of undeformed, flat-lying strata, younger layers are deposited atop older ones, such that the top layer is youngest and underlying layers increase in age with depth. Nicolaus Steno articulated the law of superposition of strata in the 17th century.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/superposition
superposition in time,"A mathematical computation that accounts for the flow-rate history in analytical models generated to match with pressure-transient test data. The pressure-derivative response can be distorted in late-time data by the effects of superposition in time, except in data acquired from an initial drawdown. Analysts must be aware of this limitation in diagnosing reservoir features from the pressure-derivative response.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/superposition_in_time
surface shut-in,"A well shut in at the surface, rather than downhole. Most transient well tests are conducted in this manner for convenience.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/surface_shut-in
surface pressure,"The pressure measured at or near the surface in a well. This measurement of pressure is usually performed by inserting a gauge into the production string just below the shut-in valve, and is also referred to as tubing-head pressure.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/surface_pressure
single-phase flow,"The flow of a single-phase fluid, such as oil, water or gas.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/single-phase_flow
skin,"A dimensionless factor calculated to determine the production efficiency of a well by comparing actual conditions with theoretical or ideal conditions. A positive skin value indicates some damage or influences that are impairing well productivity. A negative skin value indicates enhanced productivity, typically resulting from stimulation.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/skin
skin factor,"A numerical value used to analytically model the difference from the pressure drop predicted by Darcy's law due to skin. Typical values for the skin factor range from -6 for an infinite-conductivity massive hydraulic fracture to more than 100 for a poorly executed gravel pack. This value is highly dependent on the value of kh. For example, a 20-psi [138-kPa] total pressure drop related to skin effect could produce almost any skin factor, depending on the value of kh. For any given pressure drop from skin effect, the skin factor increases proportionally as kh increases.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/skin_factor
skin effect,"The loss in amplitude and change in phase of an electromagnetic field as it penetrates into a conductive medium. In an induction log, the skin effect causes a reduction of the R-signal (in-phase) and an increase in the X-signal (out-of-phase) at the receiver. It has a significant effect on the 6FF40 array, particularly below 1 ohm-m. Since the magnitude of the reduction depends on the conductivity, the skin effect can be corrected for by using a fixed function of the measured conductivity. A much improved method is to estimate the correction from the X-signal measured in balanced arrays.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/skin_effect
spherical flow,"A flow regime that occurs when the predominant flow pattern in the reservoir is toward a point. Spherical flow occurs for partial penetration and limited-entry completions. This flow regime is recognized as a -1/2 slope in the pressure derivative on the log-log diagnostic plot. Its presence enables determination of the spherical permeability. When spherical flow is followed by radial flow, both horizontal and vertical permeability can be quantified.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spherical_flow
static pressure,"The pressure measured in a well after the well has been closed in for a period of time, often after 24 or 72 hours. When a reservoir is first discovered, the static pressure equals the initial pressure. After production begins, the static pressure approaches the average reservoir pressure.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/static_pressure
steady-state behavior,"Simultaneously constant pressure (wellhead or bottomhole) and flow rate. This behavior can result when there is pressure support, either naturally through an aquifer or gas-cap drive, or artificially through water or gas injection.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/steady-state_behavior
stabilized gas well,"A gas well producing at a constant rate in which wellhead pressure changes no more than a small amount as a function of time. The actual amount of change permitted in a given time period to allow a well to be designated as stabilized may be fixed by law. Alternatively, the target stabilization for rigorous flow-after-flow testing in gas wells is pseudosteady-state flow, and this may be recognized as the pressure change versus time predicted from formation properties and drainage area size.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stabilized_gas_well
stabilization,"A state that a producing well reaches when the flow rate and well pressure are apparently constant for a reasonable period of time, such as a few hours or a day or more. The actual time period is rather arbitrary and depends on the location and the people involved. For shut-in wells, stabilization refers to a reasonably constant pressure. Stabilized pressures are commonly used as starting points for well tests. In reality, the time to stabilization at truly constant pressure and rate is infinite. The target stabilization for rigorous testing in gas wells is pseudosteady-state flow, and this may be recognized as the pressure change versus time predicted from formation properties and drainage area size. The onset of radial flow may produce an apparent stabilization that is acceptable for analysis when multirate flow periods are of equal duration.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stabilization
pressure,"The force distributed over a surface, usually measured in pounds force per square inch, or lbf/in2, or psi, in US oilfield units. The metric unit for force is the pascal (Pa), and its variations: megapascal (MPa) and kilopascal (kPa).",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pressure
transient rate and pressure test analysis,The analysis of transient rate and pressure data taken while a well is flowing at variable rates. The analysis uses either deconvolution or convolution to correct for the flow-rate variations and can make drawdown data interpretable. It has also been applied to correct for afterflow during the buildup.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transient_rate_and_pressure_test_analysis
transient drainage radius,"The calculated maximum radius in a formation in which pressure has been affected during the flow period of a transient well test. While not absolutely accurate, the value has meaning in relation to the total volume of reservoir that is represented by calculated reservoir parameters, such as kh, the permeability thickness. This may also be termed radius of investigation.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transient_drainage_radius
transient-pressure response,"The pressure response resulting from changes in a well's production rate. This includes drawdown, in which the pressure falls in response to the production of fluids; buildups, in which the pressure rises after a well is shut in; and falloffs, in which the pressure falls after an injection well is shut in.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transient-pressure_response
transient-pressure testing,"The pressure measurements recorded as a function of time, usually in the wellbore near the productive interval, after the flow rate of the well is changed. These form the basis for transient well-test analysis, and are primarily used for determining reservoir-rock properties and producing-formation limits.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transient-pressure_testing
two-phase flow,"The simultaneous flow of both oil and free gas into a wellbore. This is thought to occur through common pore spaces, where the fluids flow simultaneously. In actuality, the situation is much more complicated, and much two-phase flow occurs in a stratified manner, with lighter fluids flowing primarily through the top of a producing zone and heavier ones flowing through the bottom layers.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/two-phase_flow
transient pressure,"The change in pressure with time. In well testing, this refers to the pressure measured as a function of time after the test is initiated.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transient_pressure
type curve analysis,"A method for quantifying well and reservoir parameters such as permeability, skin, fracture half-length, dual-porosity parameters, and others, by comparing the pressure change and its derivative of the acquired data to reservoir model curve families, called type curves. When a match is found between data and a type curve, the parameters that characterize the behavior of the model providing a match are thereby determined. Originally, type-curve analysis was done manually using only the pressure change. With the introduction of the pressure derivative, the analysis requires matching both pressure change and its derivative. Computer-assisted matching permits rigorous accounting for superposition in time due to flow-rate variations before and even during (in the case of drawdown analysis) the transient data acquisition, as well as providing a continuum of solutions instead of a type-curve family derived from discrete values for the governing parameters.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/type_curve_analysis
three-phase flow,"The simultaneous flow of oil, free gas and water into a wellbore. Stratified flow is the rule rather than the exception.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/three-phase_flow
zone,"An interval or unit of rock differentiated from surrounding rocks on the basis of its fossil content or other features, such as faults or fractures. For example, a fracture zone contains numerous fractures. A biostratigraphic zone contains a particular fossil or fossils.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/z/zone
type curves,"Families of the paired pressure change and its derivative computed from a model. The model is usually generated from an analytical solution of the diffusion equation with boundary conditions strategically defined to enable observation of theoretical trends in the pressure-transient response. The boundary conditions that can be defined near the well include constant or variable wellbore storage, limited entry (partial penetration), radial composite (damage skin due to permeability alteration), and a fracture extending the cylindrical wellbore to a extended plane. The borehole trajectory can be vertical, angled, or horizontal. The distant boundary conditions include a sealing or partially sealing planar boundary (fault), intersecting faults and rectangular boundaries (sealing or constant pressure). Further, the diffusion equation can be adjusted to accommodate reservoir heterogeneity in the form of dual porosity or layering. Finally, when generated with computer assistance, the type-curve family can account for superposition in time due to flow-rate variations before and even during the transient data acquisition. Originally, type-curve families were printed on specialized (usually log-log) coordinates with dimensionless parameters defining the x and y axes. Today, commercial software can generate the type-curve families on the computer screen, enabling a much more flexible and user-friendly analysis. Further, automated regression (usually least squares) permits an optimized match between the acquired data and a selected model. Type curves have greatly enriched the ability of interpreters to extract potential explanations for transient data trends that differ from the radial-flow behavior required for conventional semilog (Horner buildup) analysis.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/type_curves
middle-time transient data,A common term for the infinite-acting radial flow regime. This portion of the pressure-transient response is between wellbore-dominated flow regimes in the early-time transient data and boundary-dominated flow regimes in the late-time transient data. This most common flow regime is the most central to pressure-transient analysis because its presence enables determination of permeability and skin.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/middle-time_transient_data
material balance,"An expression for conservation of mass governed by the observation that the amount of mass leaving a control volume is equal to the amount of mass entering the volume minus the amount of mass accumulated in the volume. Through material balance, reservoir pressures measured over time can be used to estimate the volume of hydrocarbons in place.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/material_balance
multiple-rate tests,"Tests conducted at a series of different flow rates for the purpose of determining well deliverability, typically in gas wells where non-Darcy flow near the well results in a rate-dependent skin effect. Multiple-rate tests are sometimes required by regulatory bodies.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiple-rate_tests
mobility,The ratio of effective permeability to phase viscosity. The overall mobility is a sum of the individual phase viscosities. Well productivity is directly proportional to the product of the mobility and the layer thickness product.,Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mobility
multiphase flow,"The simultaneous flow of more than one fluid phase through a porous medium. Most oil wells ultimately produce both oil and gas from the formation, and often produce water. Consequently, multiphase flow is common in oil wells. Most pressure-transient analysis techniques assume single-phase flow.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiphase_flow
modified isochronal test,"A multirate test designed as a series of drawdown and buildup sequences at different drawdown flow rates, with each drawdown and buildup of the same duration. The purpose of the test is to determine well deliverability, and this type of test is most commonly done in gas wells.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/modified_isochronal_test
effective wellbore radius,"The value of wellbore radius that produces equivalent results to those obtained using a skin factor of zero. It is possible to represent departures from ideal (zero skin) behavior by using the skin effect, or alternatively by changing the value of the effective wellbore radius. For a positive skin effect, effective wellbore radius is smaller than actual wellbore radius. For a negative skin effect, such as often obtained after well stimulation, effective wellbore radius is larger than actual well radius.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/effective_wellbore_radius
