frac fluid,"An abbreviation for fracturing fluid, a fluid injected into a well as part of a stimulation operation. Fracturing fluids for shale reservoirs usually contain water, proppant, and a small amount of nonaqueous fluids designed to reduce friction pressure while pumping the fluid into the wellbore. These fluids typically include gels, friction reducers, crosslinkers, breakers and surfactants similar to household cosmetics and cleaning products; these additives are selected for their capability to improve the results of the stimulation operation and the productivity of the well.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_fluid
frac head,A flow cross installed on top of a frac tree where treating iron is connected and treatment fluid enters the frac tree.,Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_head
fracture,"A crack or surface of breakage within rock not related to foliation or cleavage in metamorphic rock along which there has been no movement. A fracture along which there has been displacement is a fault. When walls of a fracture have moved only normal to each other, the fracture is called a joint. Fractures can enhance permeability of rocks greatly by connecting pores together, and for that reason, fractures are induced mechanically in some reservoirs in order to boost hydrocarbon flow. Fractures may also be referred to as natural fractures to distinguish them from fractures induced as part of a reservoir stimulation or drilling operation. In some shale reservoirs, natural fractures improve production by enhancing effective permeability. In other cases, natural fractures can complicate reservoir stimulation.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracture
frac stack,"A Christmas tree installed specifically for the fracturing process. A frac stack typically consists of upper and lower master valves, flow cross, wing valves, goat head, and swab valve. Frac stacks generally have larger bores and higher pressure ratings than production trees to accommodate the high flow rates and pressures necessary for hydraulic fracturing.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_stack
fracture permeability,"That portion of a dual-porosity reservoirs permeability that is associated with the secondary porosity created by open, natural fractures. In many of these reservoirs, fracture permeability can be the major controlling factor of the flow of fluids.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fracture_permeability

frac tree,"A Christmas tree installed specifically for the fracturing process. A frac tree typically consists of upper and lower master valves, flow cross, wing valves, goat head, and swab valve. Frac trees generally have larger bores and higher pressure ratings than production trees to accommodate the high flow rates and pressures necessary for hydraulic fracturing.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_tree
frac job,"Another term for hydraulic fracturing, a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing a vertical fracture to open. The wings of the fracture extend away from the wellbore in opposing directions according to the natural stresses within the formation. Proppant, such as grains of sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the fracture open when the treatment is complete. Hydraulic fracturing creates high-conductivity communication with a large area of formation and bypasses any damage that may exist in the near-wellbore area.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/frac_job

free gas,The gaseous phase present in a reservoir or other contained area. Gas may be found either dissolved in reservoir fluids or as free gas that tends to form a gas cap beneath the top seal on the reservoir trap. Both free gas and dissolved gas play important roles in the reservoir-drive mechanism.,Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/free_gas
formation evaluation while drilling,"Also known as logging while drilling or LWD, the measurement of formation properties during the excavation of the hole, or shortly thereafter, through the use of tools integrated into the bottomhole assembly. LWD, while sometimes risky and expensive, has the advantage of measuring properties of a formation before drilling fluids invade deeply. Further, many wellbores prove to be difficult or even impossible to measure with conventional wireline tools, especially highly deviated wells. In these situations, the LWD measurement ensures that some measurement of the subsurface is captured in the event that wireline operations are not possible. Timely LWD data can also be used to guide well placement so that the wellbore remains within the zone of interest or in the most productive portion of a reservoir, such as in highly variable shale reservoirs.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_evaluation_while_drilling
formation evaluation,"The measurement and analysis of formation and fluid properties through examination of formation cuttings or through the use of tools integrated into the bottomhole assembly while drilling, or conveyed on wireline or drillpipe after a borehole has been drilled. Formation evaluation is performed to assess the quantity and producibility of fluids from a reservoir. Formation evaluation guides wellsite decisions, such as placement of perforations and hydraulic fracture stages, and reservoir development and production planning.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_evaluation

geomechanics,"The geologic specialty that deals with understanding how rocks, stresses, pressures, and temperatures interact. This understanding is used to solve oilfield problems, such as optimizing hydraulic fracturing treatments of shale reservoirs. Geomechanics specialists typically work with experts in geophysics, geology, petrophysics, reservoir engineering, drilling engineering, and rock physics to solve geomechanical problems and address production challenges in shale reservoirs.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/geomechanics

High-pressure fluid returns to the missile and is directed to the well or, in the case of a multiwell pad, to a frac manifold.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/high-pressure_manifold
hydraulic fracturing,"A stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing a vertical fracture to open.

Hydraulic fracturing creates high-conductivity communication with a large area of formation and bypasses any damage that may exist in the near-wellbore area.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydraulic_fracturing
horizontal drilling,"A subset of the more general term ""directional drilling,"" used where the departure of the wellbore from vertical exceeds about 80°. Note that some horizontal wells are designed such that after reaching true 90° horizontal, the wellbore may actually start drilling upward. In such cases, the angle past 90° is continued, as in 95°, rather than reporting it as deviation from vertical, which would then be 85°. Because a horizontal well typically penetrates a greater length of the reservoir, it can offer significant production improvement over a vertical well.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/horizontal_drilling
heterogeneous,"Possessing the quality of variation in rock properties with location in a reservoir or formation. Shale gas reservoirs are heterogeneous formations whose mineralogy, organic content, natural fractures, and other properties vary from place to place. This heterogeneity makes petroleum system modeling, formation evaluation, and reservoir simulation critical to maximizing production from shale reservoirs.",Adjective,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/heterogeneous

hydraulic fracture monitoring,"A technique to track the propagation of a hydraulic fracture as it advances through a formation. Microseisms are detected, located, and displayed in time for scientists and engineers to approximate the location and propagation of the hydraulic fracture. Software provides modeling, survey design, microseismic detection and location, uncertainty analysis, data integration, and visualization for interpretation. Computer imagery is used to monitor the activity in 3D space relative to the location of the fracturing treatment. The monitored activities are animated to show progressive fracture growth and the subsurface response to pumping variations. When displayed in real time, the microseismic activity allows one to make changes to the stimulation design to ensure optimal reservoir contact. Also known as microseismic monitoring, this technique delivers information about the effectiveness of the stimulation of a reservoir that can be used to enhance reservoir development in shale gas completions.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydraulic_fracture_monitoring
bitumen,"Naturally occurring, inflammable organic matter formed from kerogen in the process of petroleum generation that is soluble in carbon bisulfide. Bitumen includes hydrocarbons such as asphalt and mineral wax. Typically solid or nearly so, brown or black, bitumen has a distinctive petroliferous odor. Laboratory dissolution with organic solvents allows determination of the amount of bitumen in samples, an assessment of source rock richness.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bitumen
basin,"A depression in the crust of the Earth, caused by plate tectonic activity and subsidence, in which sediments accumulate. Sedimentary basins vary from bowl-shaped to elongated troughs. Basins can be bounded by faults. Rift basins are commonly symmetrical; basins along continental margins tend to be asymmetrical. If rich hydrocarbon source rocks occur in combination with appropriate depth and duration of burial, then a petroleum system can develop within the basin. Most basins contain some amount of shale, thus providing opportunities for shale gas exploration and production.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/basin
buffalo head,A flow cross installed on top of a frac tree where treating iron is connected and treatment fluid enters the frac tree.,Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/buffalo_head
continuous reservoir,"A type of areally extensive reservoir that contains hydrocarbon throughout, rather than containing a water contact or being significantly affected by a water column or a defined structural closure. The areal extent of a continuous reservoir, such as a shale reservoir, can be as large as the extent of the sedimentary basin in which the shale was deposited.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/continuous_reservoir
catagenesis,"The physical and chemical alteration of sediments and pore fluids at temperatures and pressures higher than those of diagenesis. Catagenesis involves heating in the range of 50 to 150 degC [122 to 302 degF]. At these temperatures, chemical bonds break down in kerogen and clays within shale, generating liquid hydrocarbons. At the high end of this temperature range, secondary cracking of oil molecules can generate gas molecules.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/catagenesis
conventional reservoir,"A reservoir in which buoyant forces keep hydrocarbons in place below a sealing caprock. Reservoir and fluid characteristics of conventional reservoirs typically permit oil or natural gas to flow readily into wellbores. The term is used to make a distinction from shale and other unconventional reservoirs, in which gas might be distributed throughout the reservoir at the basin scale, and in which buoyant forces or the influence of a water column on the location of hydrocarbons within the reservoir are not significant.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/conventional_reservoir
core analysis,"Laboratory study of a sample of a geologic formation, usually reservoir rock, taken during or after drilling a well. Economic and efficient oil and gas production is highly dependent on understanding key properties of reservoir rock, such as porosity, permeability, and wettability. Geoscientists have developed a variety of approaches, including log and core analysis techniques, to measure these properties. Core analysis is especially important in shale reservoirs because of the vertical and lateral heterogeneity of the rocks. Core analysis can include evaluation of rock properties and anisotropy; organic matter content, maturity, and type; fluid content; fluid sensitivity; and geomechanical properties. This information can be used to calibrate log and seismic measurements and to help in well and completion design, well placement, and other aspects of reservoir production.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/core_analysis
cumulative production,"The total amount of oil and gas recovered from a reservoir as of a particular time in the life of the field. Cumulative production can be referenced to a well, a field, or a basin.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cumulative_production

completion quality (CQ),"A prediction of how effectively rock may be stimulated using hydraulic fracturing. Completion quality (CQ) is an engineering assessment of factors that determine the effectiveness of hydraulic fracture treatments and includes the ability to initiate and create an induced fracture network, the degree of reservoir contact of the newly created fractures, the level of connection to the natural fracture system of those created fractures and ability of the stimulated reservoir to deliver gas or oil into the well.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/completion-quality-cq
diagenesis,"The physical, chemical or biological alteration of sediments into sedimentary rock at relatively low temperatures and pressures that can result in changes to the rock's original mineralogy and texture. After deposition, sediments are compacted as they are buried beneath successive layers of sediment and cemented by minerals that precipitate from solution. Grains of sediment, rock fragments and fossils can be replaced by other minerals during diagenesis. Porosity usually decreases during diagenesis, except in rare cases such as dissolution of minerals and dolomitization. Diagenesis does not include weathering processes. Hydrocarbon generation begins during diagenesis. There is not a clear, accepted distinction between diagenesis and metamorphism, although metamorphism occurs at pressures and temperatures higher than those of the outer crust, where diagenesis occurs.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diagenesis
deviated drilling,"The intentional deviation of a wellbore from the path it would naturally take. This is accomplished through the use of whipstocks, bottomhole assembly (BHA) configurations, instruments to measure the path of the wellbore in three-dimensional space, data links to communicate measurements taken downhole to the surface, mud motors and special BHA components and drill bits, including rotary steerable systems, and drill bits. The directional driller also exploits drilling parameters such as weight on bit and rotary speed to deflect the bit away from the axis of the existing wellbore. In some cases, such as drilling steeply dipping formations or unpredictable deviation in conventional drilling operations, directional-drilling techniques may be employed to ensure that the hole is drilled vertically. While many techniques can accomplish this, the general concept is simple: point the bit in the direction that one wants to drill. The most common way is through the use of a bend near the bit in a downhole steerable mud motor. The bend points the bit in a direction different from the axis of the wellbore when the entire drillstring is not rotating. By pumping mud through the mud motor, the bit turns while the drillstring does not rotate, allowing the bit to drill in the direction it points. When a particular wellbore direction is achieved, that direction may be maintained by rotating the entire drillstring (including the bent section) so that the bit does not drill in a single direction off the wellbore axis, but instead sweeps around and its net direction coincides with the existing wellbore. Rotary steerable tools allow steering while rotating, usually with higher rates of penetration and ultimately smoother boreholes. Directional drilling is common in shale reservoirs because it allows drillers to place the borehole in contact with the most productive reservoir rock.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/deviated_drilling

rotary steerable system,"A tool designed to drill directionally with continuous rotation from the surface, eliminating the need to slide a steerable motor. Rotary steerable systems typically are deployed when drilling directional, horizontal, or extended-reach wells. State-of-the-art rotary steerable systems have minimal interaction with the borehole, thereby preserving borehole quality. The most advanced systems exert consistent side force similar to traditional stabilizers that rotate with the drillstring or orient the bit in the desired direction while continuously rotating at the same number of rotations per minute as the drillstring.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/rotary_steerable_system
reservoir characterization model,"A model of a specific volume of the subsurface that incorporates all the geologic characteristics of the reservoir. Such models are used to quantify characteristics within the subsurface volume that are relatively stable over long periods of time and can, therefore, be considered static. These attributes include the structural shape and thicknesses of the formations within the subsurface volume being modeled, their lithologies, and the porosity and permeability distributions. These last two characteristics often vary significantly from location to location within the volume, resulting in heterogeneity. However, porosity and permeability are stable in the near-geologic timeframe and do not change due to the movement of fluids or gases through any of the formations pore spaces. The result of reservoir characterization is a reservoir characterization model (also known as a static model and sometimes referred to as a geologic model). Shale gas reservoir rocks require the analysis of high-quality seismic data, core, and log measurements and engineering data to produce an accurate reservoir characterization model. This model is then used as input into reservoir simulation, during which reservoir engineers add other reservoir characteristics, such as pressures, temperatures, and fluid and gas compositions. These features can change due to the movement of fluids or gases through any of the formations pore spaces. Since these are dynamic in their nature over short timeframes, once production is initiated these models are referred to as dynamic models. Thorough reservoir simulations (dynamic models) that are based on accurately developed reservoir characterizations (static models) can be of significant value in optimizing well placement and field-development planning.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reservoir_characterization_model
refracturing,"An operation to restimulate a well after an initial period of production. Refracturing operations attempt to bypass near-wellbore damage, reestablish good connectivity with the reservoir, and tap portions of the reservoir with higher pore pressure. Refracturing operations are also performed after a period of production that can alter the stresses in a reservoir due to depletion; the restimulation can allow the new fracture to reorient along a different azimuth. A successful refracturing operation restores well productivity to near original or even higher rates of production and extends the productive life of a well.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/refracturing
reservoir quality (RQ),"A prediction of the likelihood of a rock to yield commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Reservoir quality (RQ) is a geologic, engineering and economic assessment of a resource, its reserves and their producibility. The term RQ includes the following factors: volume of oil or gas in place, organic content (TOC), thermal maturity, effective porosity, fluid saturations—oil, gas and water, reservoir thickness and intrinsic permeability.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reservoir-quality-rq
kerogen,"The naturally occurring, solid, insoluble organic matter that occurs in source rocks and can yield oil upon heating. Kerogen is the portion of naturally occurring organic matter that is nonextractable using organic solvents. Typical organic constituents of kerogen are algae and woody plant material. Kerogens have a high molecular weight relative to bitumen, or soluble organic matter. Bitumen forms from kerogen during petroleum generation. Kerogens are described as Type I, consisting of mainly algal and amorphous (but presumably algal) kerogen and highly likely to generate oil; Type II, mixed terrestrial and marine source material that can generate waxy oil; and Type III, woody terrestrial source material that typically generates gas.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/k/kerogen

perforate,"To create holes in the casing or liner to achieve efficient communication between the reservoir and the wellbore. The characteristics and placement of the communication paths (perforations) can have significant influence on the productivity of the well. Therefore, a robust design and execution process should be followed to ensure efficient creation of the appropriate number, size and orientation of perforations. A perforating gun assembly with the appropriate configuration of shaped explosive charges and the means to verify or correlate the correct perforating depth can be deployed on wireline, tubing or coiled tubing.",Verb,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/perforate
produced water,A term used to describe water produced from a wellbore that is not a treatment fluid. The characteristics of produced water vary and use of the term often implies an inexact or unknown composition. It is generally accepted that water within the pores of shale reservoirs is not produced due to its low relative permeability and its mobility being lower than that of gas.,Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/produced_water

proppant,"Sized particles mixed with fracturing fluid to hold fractures open after a hydraulic fracturing treatment. In addition to naturally occurring sand grains, man-made or specially engineered proppants, such as resin-coated sand or high-strength ceramic materials like sintered bauxite, may also be used. Proppant materials are carefully sorted for size and sphericity to provide an efficient conduit for production of fluid from the reservoir to the wellbore.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/proppant
pyrolysis,"A type of geochemical analysis in which a rock sample is subject to controlled heating in an inert gas to or past the point of generating hydrocarbons in order to assess its quality as a source rock, the abundance of organic material in it, its thermal maturity, and the quality of hydrocarbons it might generate or have generated. Pyrolysis breaks large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules. This process is used to determine the quality of shale as a source rock and is instrumental in evaluating shale gas plays.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pyrolysis
unconventional resource,"An umbrella term for oil and natural gas that is produced by means that do not meet the criteria for conventional production. What has qualified as unconventional at any particular time is a complex function of resource characteristics, the available exploration and production technologies, the economic environment, and the scale, frequency and duration of production from the resource. Perceptions of these factors inevitably change over time and often differ among users of the term. At present, the term is used in reference to oil and gas resources whose porosity, permeability, fluid trapping mechanism, or other characteristics differ from conventional sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. Coalbed methane, gas hydrates, shale gas, fractured reservoirs, and tight gas sands are considered unconventional resources.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/unconventional_resource
vitrinite reflectance,A measurement of the maturity of organic matter with respect to whether it has generated hydrocarbons or could be an effective source rock.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/vitrinite_reflectance
well stimulation,"A treatment performed to restore or enhance the productivity of a well. Stimulation treatments fall into two main groups, hydraulic fracturing treatments and matrix treatments. Fracturing treatments are performed above the fracture pressure of the reservoir formation and create a highly conductive flow path between the reservoir and the wellbore. Matrix treatments are performed below the reservoir fracture pressure and generally are designed to restore the natural permeability of the reservoir following damage to the near-wellbore area. Stimulation in shale gas reservoirs typically takes the form of hydraulic fracturing treatments.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_stimulation
well plan,"The description of a proposed wellbore, including the shape, orientation, depth, completion, and evaluation. Well plans might be relatively simple for vertical wellbores. Directional or horizontal wellbores require more detailed planning about where to land the well and begin directional drilling, how long the directional or horizontal section should be, and how to evaluate and complete the well. Shale gas wells, many of which are horizontal wells, require highly detailed well plans to optimize production from reservoirs that are vertically and laterally heterogeneous.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_plan
well placement,Activities associated with drilling a wellbore to intercept one of more specified locations. The term usually is used in reference to directional or horizontal wells that are oriented to maximize contact with the most productive parts of reservoirs via hydraulic fracturing or to optimize intersection with natural fractures. Geomechanical analysis of natural fractures and stresses and geological analysis of the reservoir are critical to successful well planning. Advanced formation evaluation and drilling technology support the drilling operation in real time.,Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_placement

analog,"An example used for comparison. In oil and gas exploration, geoscientists and engineers compare new prospects and fields with fields and surface exposures thought to be similar in depositional environment and reservoir character to guide predictions. Wide variations in shale reservoirs create doubt about the utility of analog comparisons.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/analog
anisotropy,"Predictable variation of a property of a material with the direction in which it is measured, which can occur at all scales. For a crystal of a mineral, variation in physical properties observed in different directions is anisotropy.

Often found where platy minerals such as micas and clays align parallel to depositional bedding as sediments are compacted, anisotropy is common in shales.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/anisotropy
aeolotropy,"Predictable variation of a property of a material with the direction in which it is measured, which can occur at all scales. For a crystal of a mineral, variation in physical properties observed in different directions is aeolotropy (also known as anisotropy). In rocks, variation in seismic velocity measured parallel or perpendicular to bedding surfaces is a form of aeolotropy. Often found where platy minerals such as micas and clays align parallel to depositional bedding as sediments are compacted, aeolotropy is common in shales.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/aeolotropy
adsorbed gas,"The gas accumulated on the surface of a solid material, such as a grain of a reservoir rock, or more particularly the organic particles in a shale reservoir. Measurement of adsorbed gas and interstitial gas, which is the gas contained in pore spaces, allows calculation of gas in place in a reservoir.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/adsorbed_gas
azimuth,"The angle between the vertical projection of a line of interest onto a horizontal surface and true north or magnetic north measured in a horizontal plane, typically measured clockwise from north.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/azimuth
stimulation,"A treatment performed to restore or enhance the productivity of a well. Stimulation treatments fall into two main groups, hydraulic fracturing treatments and matrix treatments. Fracturing treatments are performed above the fracture pressure of the reservoir formation and create a highly conductive flow path between the reservoir and the wellbore. Matrix treatments are performed below the reservoir fracture pressure and generally are designed to restore the natural permeability of the reservoir following damage to the near-wellbore area. Stimulation in shale gas reservoirs typically takes the form of hydraulic fracturing treatments.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stimulation
sweet spot,"Colloquial expression for a target location or area within a play or a reservoir that represents the best production or potential production. Geoscientists and engineers attempt to map sweet spots enable wellbores to be placed in the most productive areas of the reservoir. Sweet spots in shale reservoirs may be defined by source-rock richness or thickness, by natural fractures, or by other factors, using geological data such as core analysis, well log data, or seismic data.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sweet_spot
source rock,"A rock rich in organic matter which, if heated sufficiently, will generate oil or gas. Typical source rocks, usually shales or limestones, contain about 1% organic matter and at least 0.5% total organic carbon (TOC), although a rich source rock might have as much as 10% organic matter. Rocks of marine origin tend to be oil-prone, whereas terrestrial source rocks (such as coal) tend to be gas-prone. Preservation of organic matter without degradation is critical to creating a good source rock, and necessary for a complete petroleum system. Under the right conditions, source rocks may also be reservoir rocks, as in the case of shale gas reservoirs.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/source_rock
shaly,"Containing shale, a fine-grained, fissile, detrital sedimentary rock formed by consolidation of clay- and silt-sized particles into thin, relatively impermeable layers. It is the most abundant sedimentary rock. Shale can include relatively large amounts of organic material compared with other rock types and thus has potential to become a rich hydrocarbon source rock, even though a typical shale contains just 1% organic matter. Its typical fine grain size and lack of permeability, a consequence of the alignment of its platy or flaky grains, allow shale to form a good cap rock for hydrocarbon traps. Gas shows from shales during drilling have led some shales to be targeted as potential gas reservoirs. Various clay types and volumes influence the quality of the reservoir from a petrophysical and geomechanical perspective. The quality of shale reservoirs depends on their thickness and extent, organic content, thermal maturity, depth and pressure, fluid saturations, and permeability, among other factors.",Adjective,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shaly

staged fracturing,"An operation in which numerous reservoir intervals are hydraulically stimulated in succession. Staged hydraulic fracturing operations are commonly performed from horizontal wellbores placed in shale gas reservoirs. Using geomechanical data, engineers are able to optimize the placement of perforations and fracturing stages to maximize gas production.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/staged_fracturing
completion,"The hardware used to optimize the production of hydrocarbons from the well. This may range from nothing but a packer on tubing above an openhole completion (""barefoot"" completion), to a system of mechanical filtering elements outside of perforated pipe, to a fully automated measurement and control system that optimizes reservoir economics without human intervention (an ""intelligent"" completion).",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/completion
TOC,"The concentration of organic material in source rocks as represented by the weight percent of organic carbon. A value of approximately 0.5% total organic carbon by weight percent is considered the minimum for an effective source rock, although values of 2% are considered the minimum for shale gas reservoirs; values exceeding 10% exist, although some geoscientists assert that high total organic carbon values indicate the possibility of kerogen filling pore space rather than other forms of hydrocarbons. Total organic carbon is measured from 1-g samples of pulverized rock that are combusted and converted to CO or CO2. If a sample appears to contain sufficient total organic carbon to generate hydrocarbons, it may be subjected to pyrolysis.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/toc

tight,"Describing a relatively impermeable reservoir rock from which hydrocarbon production is difficult. Reservoirs can be tight because of smaller grains or matrix between larger grains, or they might be tight because they consist predominantly of silt- or clay-sized grains, as is the case for shale reservoirs. Stimulation of tight formations can result in increased production from formations that previously would have been abandoned or produced uneconomically.",Adjective,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tight
tight gas,Gas produced from a relatively impermeable reservoir rock. Hydrocarbon production from tight reservoirs can be difficult without stimulation operations. Stimulation of tight formations can result in increased production from formations that previously might have been abandoned or been produced uneconomically. The term is generally used for reservoirs other than shales.,Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tight_gas
thermal maturity,The degree of heating of a source rock in the process of transforming kerogen into hydrocarbon. Thermal maturity is commonly evaluated by measuring vitrinite reflectance or by pyrolysis.,Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thermal_maturity
metagenesis,"The last stage of maturation and conversion of organic matter to hydrocarbons. Metagenesis occurs at temperatures of 150 to 200 degC [302 to 392 degF]. At the end of metagenesis, methane, or dry gas, is evolved along with nonhydrocarbon gases such as CO2, N2, and H2S, as oil molecules are cracked into smaller gas molecules.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/metagenesis
microseismic monitoring,"A technique to track the propagation of a hydraulic fracture as it advances through a formation. Microseisms are detected, located, and displayed in time for scientists and engineers to approximate the location and propagation of the hydraulic fracture. Software provides modeling, survey design, microseismic detection and location, uncertainty analysis, data integration, and visualization for interpretation. Computer imagery is used to monitor the activity in 3D space relative to the location of the fracturing treatment. The monitored activities are animated to show progressive fracture growth and the subsurface response to pumping variations. When displayed in real time, the microseismic activity allows one to make changes to the stimulation design to ensure optimal reservoir contact. Also known as hydraulic fracture monitoring, this technique delivers information about the effectiveness of the stimulation of a reservoir that can be used to enhance reservoir development in shale gas completions.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/microseismic_monitoring
maturation,"The process of a source rock becoming capable of generating oil or gas when exposed to appropriate pressures and temperatures. As a source rock begins to mature, it generates hydrocarbons. As an oil-prone source rock matures, the generation of heavy oils is succeeded by medium and light oils and condensates. Above a temperature of approximately 100 degC [212 degF], only dry gas is generated, and incipient metamorphism is imminent. The maturity of a source rock reflects the ambient pressure and temperature as well as the duration of conditions favorable for hydrocarbon generation. Understanding maturation is especially important in shale reservoirs because of the shales dual role as source rock and reservoir rock.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/maturation
mudrock,"A fine-grained detrital sedimentary rock formed by consolidation of clay- and silt-sized particles. Mudrocks are highly variable in their clay content and are often rich in carbonate material. As a consequence, they are less fissile, or susceptible to splitting along planes, than shales. Mudrocks may include relatively large amounts of organic material compared with other rock types and thus have potential to become rich hydrocarbon source rocks. The typical fine grain size and low permeability, a consequence of the alignment of their platy or flaky grains, allow mudrocks to form good cap rocks for hydrocarbon traps. However, mudrocks are also capable of being reservoir rocks, as evidenced by the many wells drilled into them to produce gas.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mudrock
missile,"Flow control unit used in the pressurization of fluid employed in hydraulic fracturing. Fracturing fluid enters the missile at low pressure and is directed to the pump trucks for pressurization. High-pressure fluid returns to the missile and is directed to the well or, in the case of a multiwell pad, to a frac manifold.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/missile
exploration play,"An area in which hydrocarbon accumulations or prospects of a given type occur. For example the shale gas plays in North America include the Barnett, Eagle Ford, Fayetteville, Haynesville, Marcellus, and Woodford, among many others. Outside North America, shale gas potential is being pursued in many parts of Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/exploration_play
estimated ultimate recovery,"The amount of oil and gas expected to be economically recovered from a reservoir or field by the end of its producing life. Estimated ultimate recovery can be referenced to a well, a field, or a basin.",Noun,Shale Gas,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/estimated_ultimate_recovery
