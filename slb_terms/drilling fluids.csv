external phase,The continuous phase of an emulsion. The internal phase is the dispersed droplets of emulsified fluid.,Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/external_phase
endpoint,"During a titration procedure in analytical chemistry, the point at which reagent addition should be immediately stopped and the volume of reagent recorded. The endpoint represents the end of a specific chemical reaction, such as precipitation, and may be indicated by a color change, a voltage or pH reading or an inflection point on a graphical plot of the data.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/endpoint
ES test,"A test for oil-base and synthetic-base muds that indicates the emulsion and oil-wetting qualities of the sample. The test is performed by inserting the ES probe into a cup of 120 degF [48.9 degC] mud and pushing a test button. The ES meter automatically applies an increasing voltage (from 0 to 2,000 volts) across an electrode gap in the probe. Maximum voltage that the mud will sustain across the gap before conducting current is displayed as the ES voltage. The modern ES meter has sine-wave circuitry, whereas older meters used square-wave circuits. (The older units should not be used because they do not correctly address the theory described in the reference below.) The ES sine-wave design and meaning of ES readings have been studied and were found to relate to an oil mud's oil-wetting of solids and to stability of the emulsion droplets in a complex fashion not yet understood.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/es_test

A tracer must become a part of the filtrate, remaining in true solution and moving with the filtrate into permeable zones. It must not be a component in the strata that is expected to migrate, be adsorbed on clays, or degraded. It should be measurable in trace amounts and safe to handle.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/filtrate_tracer
filtration tester,"Equipment used to measure filtration under dynamic conditions. Two commercial dynamic-filtration testers are available, one of which uses a thick-walled cylinder with rock-like characteristics as the filter medium to simulate radial flow into a wellbore. The other tester uses flat porous disks, such as paper or fused ceramic plates, as filter media. In a dynamic test, filter cake is continually eroded and deposited. Data from this test include a steady-state filtration rate measured during the test, and cake thickness, cake quality and return permeability of the filter medium measured at the conclusion of a test.

Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filtercake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filtercake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filtercake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/filtercake

Three alkali-metal formates are used in drilling, drill-in and completion fluids, (1) sodium formate, HCOO-Na+, (2) potassium formate, HCOO-K+ and (3) cesium formate, HCOO-Cs+. Clear solutions of each can reach densities of 1.32, 1.58 and 2.4 g/cm3, respectively. They are near neutral pH and meet HSE standards. Most formates can be mixed together over broad ranges of concentration or temperature without solubility or crystallization problems.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formate
formation damage,"Alteration of the far-field or virgin characteristics of a producing formation, usually by exposure to drilling fluids. The water or solid particles in the drilling fluids, or both, tend to decrease the pore volume and effective permeability of the producible formation in the near-wellbore region. At least two mechanisms are at work. First, solid particles from the drilling fluid physically plug or bridge across flowpaths in the porous formation. Second, when water contacts certain clay minerals in the formation, the clay typically swells, increasing in volume and decreasing the pore volume. Third, chemical reactions between the drilling fluid and the formation rock and fluids can precipitate solids or semisolids that plug pore spaces. One approach to minimize formation damage is to use drill-in or completion fluids that are specially formulated to avoid damage to the formation when drilling pay zones, rather than ordinary drilling fluids.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_damage
fluid-loss control,"The act or means of controlling (usually lowering) the volume of filtrate that passes through a filter medium. Control of fluid loss for a mud is achieved by several means, one of which is by addition of fluid-loss-control materials to the mud system. Another is to change the mud chemistry to make the materials already present work better. Adding a clay deflocculant to freshwater mud typically improves fluid-loss control.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fluid-loss_control
fluid-loss-control material,A group of mud additives specifically designed to lower the volume of filtrate that passes through a filter medium.

gyp mud,"A calcium-based water mud system containing gypsum. Gyp mud can be used for drilling shales, but it is also well-suited for drilling gypsum, anhydrite and salt stringers. An advantage of gyp over lime muds is that the pH of gyp mud need not be so high because it contains more soluble Ca+2 to inhibit shale swelling. Gypsum, CaSO4·2H2O, content is measured by an API test, and more can be added as needed. A calcium-tolerant clay deflocculant may be needed to control viscosity. Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and starch are used for fluid loss control along with a small amount of prehydrated bentonite.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gyp_mud

Garrett Gas Train,"An instrument used for quantitative analyses of sulfides and carbonates. Specific test methods have been published by API. The oil-mud procedure analyzes active sulfides and uses whole mud samples, whereas the water-base drilling fluid procedure tests filtrate. The Garrett Gas Train (GGT) unit is a clear, plastic block (2.5 in x 4 in x 6 in) that contains three interconnected chambers. A carrier gas is used to flow an inert gas through the chambers. The sample is placed in chamber #1 and is acidified to release sulfides as H2S and carbonates as CO2. The appropriate Dräger tube is used to measure the effluent gas that is evolved from the sample. The device is named after Bob Garrett, who invented it while at Exxon Production Research.

gas-cut mud,"A drilling fluid (or mud) that has gas (air or natural gas) bubbles in it, resulting in a lower bulk, unpressurized density compared with a mud not cut by gas. The density of gas-cut mud can be measured accurately using a pressurized mud balance. Defoamer chemicals added to the mud or a mechanical vacuum pump degasser can liberate the trapped gas. The derrickman periodically measures mud density and communicates the results to the drilling crew via an intercom, typically reporting something like ""9.6 heavy,"" ""10.4,"" or ""13.2 light,"" indicating more than 9.6 pounds per gallon, 10.4 pounds per gallon, or less than 13.2 pounds per gallon, respectively. Each tenth of a pound per gallon is referred to as a ""point"" of mud weight. Note that for this low-accuracy measurement, no direct mention of gas cut is made. A gas cut is inferred only if the mud returning to the surface is significantly less dense than it should be.

hydrogen sulfide,"[H2S] An extraordinarily poisonous gas with a molecular formula of H2S. At low concentrations, H2S has the odor of rotten eggs, but at higher, lethal concentrations, it is odorless. H2S is hazardous to workers and a few seconds of exposure at relatively low concentrations can be lethal, but exposure to lower concentrations can also be harmful. The effect of H2S depends on duration, frequency and intensity of exposure as well as the susceptibility of the individual. Hydrogen sulfide is a serious and potentially lethal hazard, so awareness, detection and monitoring of H2S is essential. Since hydrogen sulfide gas is present in some subsurface formations, drilling and other operational crews must be prepared to use detection equipment, personal protective equipment, proper training and contingency procedures in H2S-prone areas. Hydrogen sulfide is produced during the decomposition of organic matter and occurs with hydrocarbons in some areas. It enters drilling mud from subsurface formations and can also be generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria in stored muds. H2S can cause sulfide-stress-corrosion cracking of metals. Because it is corrosive, H2S production may require costly special production equipment such as stainless steel tubing. Sulfides can be precipitated harmlessly from water muds or oil muds by treatments with the proper sulfide scavenger. H2S is a weak acid, donating two hydrogen ions in neutralization reactions, forming HS- and S-2 ions. In water or water-base muds, the three sulfide species, H2S and HS- and S-2 ions, are in dynamic equilibrium with water and H+ and OH- ions. The percent distribution among the three sulfide species depends on pH. H2S is dominant at low pH, the HS- ion is dominant at mid-range pH and S2 ions dominate at high pH. In this equilibrium situation, sulfide ions revert to H2S if pH falls. Sulfides in water mud and oil mud can be quantitatively measured with the Garrett Gas Train according to procedures set by API.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrogen_sulfide

HEC is not degraded by common bacteria.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydroxyethylcellulose
hydroxypropyl starch,"Hydroxypropyl starch is a derivative of natural starch, used primarily for fluid-loss control in drilling muds, drill-in, completion and workover fluids. Being nonionic, it is only slightly affected by salinity and hardness in fluids. Linear and branched carbohydrate polymers in natural starch have three reactive OH groups on each glucose unit. During manufacture, these polymers are reacted with propylene oxide, adding hydroxypropyl (CH(OH)CH2CH3) groups at the OH positions by an ether linkage.

black list,"List of products considered unsuitable by the Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPAR) for discharge, including mercury, cadmium, and 'persistent oils and hydrocarbons of a petroleum origin.' OSPAR, formerly known as PARCOM, is a group of experts who advise North Sea countries on environmental policy and legislation. The group has been influential in establishing North Sea legislation on drilling fluids that has served as the model for other operating areas. The Commission has published lists of environmentally acceptable and unacceptable products, referred to as the ""green,"" ""gray,"" and ""black"" lists. The inclusion of hydrocarbons in the black list has been the driving force behind the reduction of oil discharges in the North Sea and elsewhere and has serious implications for the use of oil- and synthetic-based fluids.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/black_list
Blaine fineness,"The particle size or fineness of a cement in cm2/g or m2/kg, usually determined from air permeability tests using a device known as a Blaine permeameter.

bland coring fluid,"A coring fluid formulated with components that are not likely to alter the wettability in the pores of the rock sample and that has low dynamic filtration characteristics. These qualities help retain the core's native properties and can retain some (or all) of the reservoir's fluids [water, oil and gas (gas only if kept under pressure)]. Bland water-based fluid is formulated to make the filtrate resemble the connate water in the reservoir. Keeping ionic composition and especially the pH matched to the reservoir water is most important. Thus, strong alkaline agents and clay deflocculants are avoided when designing bland coring fluids. Bland oil-based fluids should contain no water phase, and the base oil should resemble the reservoir oil. (Reservoir crude is used in some cases.) Amine, amide, phosphonated and sulfonated emulsifiers, and the powerful oil-wetting agents are also avoided. Fatty acid soaps are chosen to emulsify the trace of water that is likely to be encountered. Additives that minimize dynamic filtration rate must be chosen. Setting mud density and bit hydraulics to give equivalent circulating density close to the reservoir pressure helps avoid filtrate invasion into the core. Designing core bits to core as fast as possible also limits filtrate invasion ahead of the bit.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bland_coring_fluid

Bactericide choices are limited and care must be taken to find those that are effective yet approved by governments and by company policy. Bactericides, also called biocides, can be used to control sulfate-reducing bacteria, slime-forming bacteria, iron-oxidizing bacteria and bacteria that attacks polymers in fracture and secondary recovery fluids. In polymers, the degradation of the fluid is controlled, thus avoiding the formation of a large biomass, which could plug the formation and reduce permeability.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/biocide

bioassay,"A laboratory test or other assessment utilizing a living organism, such as mysid shrimp, to determine the effect of a condition to which the organism is exposed. Such tests are performed under controlled environmental conditions and duration. Bioassay tests of drilling fluids are required by governmental agencies throughout the world prior to discharge of mud or cuttings. The organisms used in bioassays are those found in the area that would be most affected by contact with the proposed drilling fluid. The dosage of interest is typically the lethal concentration, known as LC50, that will kill 50% of the population of organisms in a given period of time. Chronic bioassay tests indicate sublethal effects, such as changes in growth or reproduction of the organism over a longer period of time.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bioassay
bioaccumulation,"The concentration of a particular substance in a living organism, possibly with harmful effects. The likelihood of this occurring is expressed as the bioaccumulation potential and can be estimated by the octanol/water partition coefficient, expressed as logPOW. This test is commonly required on drilling fluid additives in the North Sea area and other countries following the Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPAR) regulations. Values of logPOW below 3 indicate no bioaccumulation tendency; values between 3 and 6 indicate that bioaccumulation is possible, providing the substance is small enough to pass through the cell wall (mol. wt. < 600). This may be confirmed by a bioconcentration test in which a population of animals is exposed to the product.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bioaccumulation
balanced-activity oil mud,"An oil-based mud in which the activity, or vapor pressure, of the brine phase is balanced with that of the formations drilled. Although long shale sections may not have a constant value for vapor pressure, aw, the oil mud will adjust osmotically to achieve an ""average"" aw value. Dynamic (autopilot) balance of mud salinity and drilled shales is maintained because as water moves into or out of the mud, it also moves out of or into the shale. As water transfer continues during drilling, the mud's water phase will be either diluted or concentrated in CaCl2 as needed to match the average aw value of the shale section and cuttings exposed to the mud.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/balanced-activity_oil_mud

In mud laboratory experiments, 350 cm3 is the volume chosen to represent 42 US gallons (1 oilfield barrel) [0.159 m3], so that 1.0 gram mass represents 1.0 lbm. This is a convenient concept for mud technicians to use when mixing or pilot-testing mud samples. For example, in preparing a mud formulation or for pilot-testing purposes, adding 1.0 gram to 350 cm3 of fluid is the experimental equivalent of adding 1.0 lbm to 42 galUS [1.0 bbl] of fluid.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/barrel_equivalent

base exchange,"The quantity of positively charged ions (cations) that a clay mineral or similar material can accommodate on its negatively charged surface, expressed as milli-ion equivalent per 100 g, or more commonly as milliequivalent (meq) per 100 g. Clays are aluminosilicates in which some of the aluminum and silicon ions have been replaced by elements with different valence, or charge. For example, aluminum (Al+++) may be replaced by iron (Fe++) or magnesium (Mg++), leading to a net negative charge. This charge attracts cations when the clay is immersed in an electrolyte such as salty water and causes an electrical double layer. The cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is often expressed in terms of its contribution per unit pore volume, Qv. In formation evaluation, it is the contribution of cation-exchange sites to the formation electrical properties that is important. Various techniques are used to measure CEC in the laboratory, such as wet chemistry, multiple salinity and membrane potential. Wet chemistry methods, such as conductometric titration, usually involve destruction or alteration of the rock. Although quicker and simpler to perform, they are less representative of electrical properties in situ. The multiple salinity and membrane potential methods are more direct measurements of the effect of CEC on formation resistivity and spontaneous potential.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/base_exchange

bypassed mud,Mud that is left somewhere in the wellbore when some other fluid is pumped into the well. This can occur when pumping an oil mud into a well to displace a water mud. The bypassed water mud becomes a contaminant in the oil mud when it gets mixed into the circulating system. Drilling mud may be bypassed behind a casing or a liner when pumping cement into the casing or wellbore annular region. This mud-contaminated cement might not set up and might not satisfactorily isolate zones.,Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bypassed_mud

buffer,"A chemical system that resists a change in pH. It comprises three components: water, weak acid (or weak base) and salt of the weak acid (or salt of weak base). In a buffered system, the concentration of H+ and OH– ions remain relatively constant because they are in equilibrium with one or more of the other two components, even with the addition of acids or bases.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/buffer
buffered mud,"A type of mud that contains the three components that form a chemical buffer, whether by design or by coincidence. Buffering results from components that react with the added OH- ions (or added H+ ions) forming slightly soluble or slightly ionized compounds. Water is one component of a buffer and various ions are the other components, such as bicarbonates, carbonates, lignite, lignosulfonate, silicate and sulfide. Clay solids are buffers because of their ability to accept or donate H+ ions on their surface. The pH of a buffered mud will not increase as fast as expected after addition of caustic soda, for example.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/buffered_mud

bottomhole static temperature,"The temperature of the undisturbed formation at the final depth in a well. The formation cools during drilling, and most of the cooling dissipates after about 24 hours of static conditions, although it is theoretically impossible for the temperature to return to undisturbed conditions. This temperature is measured under static conditions after sufficient time has elapsed to negate any effects from circulating fluids. Tables, charts, and computer routines are used to predict BHST as functions of depth, geographic area, and various time functions. The BHST is generally higher than the bottomhole circulating temperature and can be an important factor when using temperature-sensitive tools or treatments.",Noun,"Drilling, Well Completions",https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bottomhole_static_temperature
bottoms-up mud sample,"A sample of mud from the deepest or current drilling depth of a well. The term refers particularly to a mud sample that has experienced stagnant conditions at the bottom of the hole, including the temperature, pressure, and other conditions at that depth. A bottoms-up sample is commonly collected after a trip out of the hole or if an influx of formation fluid is suspected.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bottoms-up_mud_sample
bottomhole circulating temperature,"The temperature of the circulating fluid (air, mud, cement, or water) at the bottom of the wellbore after several hours of circulation. This temperature is lower than the bottomhole static temperature. Therefore, in extremely harsh environments, a component or fluid that would not ordinarily be suitable under bottomhole static conditions can be used with great care in circulating conditions. Similarly, a high-temperature well can be cooled down in an attempt to allow logging tools to function. The BHCT is also important in the design of operations to cement casing because the setting time for cement is temperature-dependent. The BHCT and bottomhole static temperature (BHST) are important parameters when placing large volumes of temperature-sensitive treatment fluids.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bottomhole_circulating_temperature
coalesce,"To grow, as in the process of droplet growth, through small drops merging when they come in contact. If this occurs repeatedly, a continuous liquid phase forms. Through this phenomenon, emulsions break and form two distinct liquid phases that tend to separate. In oil-base mud, the water phase is dispersed as small droplets, with oil as the continuous (external) phase. A stable oil mud will remain dispersed under normal drilling conditions because when droplets contact each other, they do not coalesce due to the strong emulsifier film around each droplet. However, when the emulsion film around each droplet becomes weakened, droplets will begin to coalesce. If not corrected, this can lead to total emulsion breakdown with solids becoming water-wetted.",Verb,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/coalesce

clathrate,"An unusual occurrence of hydrocarbon in which molecules of natural gas, typically methane, are trapped in ice molecules. More generally, hydrates are compounds in which gas molecules are trapped within a crystal structure. Hydrates form in cold climates, such as permafrost zones and in deep water. To date, economic liberation of hydrocarbon gases from hydrates has not occurred, but hydrates contain quantities of hydrocarbons that could be of great economic significance. Hydrates can affect seismic data by creating a reflection or multiple.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/clathrate
clay-water interaction,"An all-inclusive term to describe various progressive interactions between clay minerals and water.

clay extender,"A class of polymers added to a drilling-grade clay mineral during grinding, or added directly into a clay-based mud system, to enhance the clay's rheological performance. In concept, clay-extender polymers achieve the type of rheology needed for fast drilling with fewer colloidal solids and lower viscosity at high shear rate (at the bit). This is the concept of a ""low-solids, nondispersed mud"" system. Extenders are usually long-chain anionic or nonionic polymers that link clay platelets together in large networks. Anionic polymers are highly effective but can be precipitated by hardness ions. Nonionic polymers are less effective but also much less sensitive to hardness ions. Excessively long, linear polymers may break up under mechanical shearing. Either by precipitation or breakup, extender polymers can quickly become ineffective if poorly chosen and used improperly. A drilling-grade clay that has no extender is that which meets the standard for API nontreated bentonite. API bentonite and OCMA-grade API bentonite usually contain extender polymers.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/clay_extender
carrying capacity,"The ability of a circulating drilling fluid to transport rock fragments out of a wellbore.

clear-water drilling,"Drilling operations using a water-base drilling fluid that contains few solids. Clear-water drilling is done in ""hard rocks"" in which density and fluid loss are not critical. Rapid drilling rate is the incentive for using a solids-free mud. Fluid returned to the surface must be screened and processed by hydrocyclones and centrifuges to remove larger solids. Colloidal solids can be agglomerated by adding polymers and removing the aggregates. Polymers such as acrylates, acrylamides and partially-hydrolyzed polyacrylamides are used. They are added at the flowline as mud exits the well or added in pits downstream from the flowline.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/clear-water_drilling
carboxymethyl starch,"A natural starch derivative. CMS is used primarily for fluid-loss control in drilling muds, drill-in, completion, and workover fluids. It is slightly anionic and can be affected by hardness and other electrolytes in a mud. CMS is similar to CMC (carboxymethylcellulose) in method of manufacture and many of its uses. The linear and branched starch polymers in natural starch react with monochloroacetic acid in alkaline solution, adding carboxymethyl groups at the OH positions by an ether linkage. By adding the carboxymethyl groups, the starch becomes more resistant to thermal degradation and bacterial attack.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/carboxymethyl_starch
clear brine,Water containing more dissolved inorganic salt than typical seawater.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/clear_brine
carboxymethylcellulose,"A drilling-fluid additive used primarily for fluid-loss control, manufactured by reacting natural cellulose with monochloroacetic acid and sodium hydroxide [NaOH] to form CMC sodium salt. Up to 20 wt% of CMC may be NaCl, a by-product of manufacture, but purified grades of CMC contain only small amounts of NaCl. To make CMC, OH groups on the glucose rings of cellulose are ether-linked to carboxymethyl (-OCH2-COO–) groups. (Note the negative charge.) Each glucose ring has three OH groups capable of reaction, degree-of-substitution = 3. Degree of substitution determines water solubility and negativity of the polymer, which influences a CMC's effectiveness as a mud additive. Drilling grade CMCs used in muds typically have degree-of-substitution around 0.80 to 0.96. Carboxymethylcellulose is commonly supplied either as low-viscosity (""CMC-Lo Vis"") or high-viscosity (""CMC-Hi Vis"") grades, both of which have API specifications. The viscosity depends largely on the molecular weight of the starting cellulose material.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/carboxymethylcellulose
carbon dioxide,"The compound with the formula CO2. An odorless gas, carbon dioxide [CO2] is widely distributed in nature and is a minor component of air. It is highly soluble in water and oil, especially under pressure. In water, it occurs as carbonic acid, a weak acid that can donate one or two hydrogen ions in neutralization reactions that produce bicarbonate [HCO3–] and carbonate [CO3–2] salts or ions. CO2, being an acid in water, reacts instantly with NaOH or KOH in an alkaline water mud, forming carbonate and bicarbonate ions. Similarly, it reacts with Ca(OH)2 (lime) to form insoluble calcium carbonate and water.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/carbon_dioxide
cake thickness,"A measurement of the thickness of the filtercake, usually recorded in 32nds of an inch. Under dynamic conditions, filtercake thickness depends on rate of deposition versus erosion caused by fluid circulation and mechanical abrasion by the rotating drillstring. Typically, the filtercake will reach an equilibrium thickness in the wellbore. In laboratory tests, however, filtercake is built under static conditions with no erosion.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cake_thickness
capillary suction time test,"A type of static filtration test for water-based drilling fluid that measures the filtration rate (time for free water to pass between two electrodes) using filter paper as the medium.

cake,"The residue deposited on a permeable medium when a slurry, such as a drilling fluid, is forced against the medium under a pressure. Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filtercake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filtercake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filtercake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cake
calcium oxide,"A chemical with formula CaO, commonly called quick lime or hot lime. When hydrated with one mole of water, it forms slaked lime, Ca(OH)2. Quick lime is used in preference to slaked lime at oil mud mixing plants because it generates heat when it becomes slaked with water and therefore speeds up emulsification by the reaction to form calcium fatty-acid soap.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/calcium_oxide
calcium hydroxide,"A chemical with formula Ca(OH)2, commonly called slaked lime. Lime is used in lime muds and as a treatment to remove carbonate ions.

calcium carbonate,"A compound with formula CaCO3 that occurs naturally as limestone. Ground and sized calcium carbonate is used to increase mud density to about 12 lbm/galUS [1.44 kg/m3], and is preferable to barite because it is acid-soluble and can be dissolved with hydrochloric acid to clean up production zones. Its primary use today is as a bridging material in drill-in, completion, and workover fluids. Sized calcium carbonate particles, along with polymers, control fluid loss in brines or drill-in, completion, and workover fluids. Insoluble calcium carbonate is the precipitated by-product of mud treatments used for removal of either Ca+2 or CO3–2 by addition of the other ion.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/calcium_carbonate
calcium sulfate,"The chemical CaSO4, which occurs naturally as the mineral anhydrite. Gypsum is the dihydrate mineral form, CaSO4·2H2O.

calcium contamination,"A contamination problem caused by Ca+2 ions, usually occurring in freshwater, seawater, and other low-salinity and low-hardness mud systems. Soluble calcium comes into a mud from various sources: gypsum- or anhydrite-bearing strata, unset cement and hardness ions in makeup water, or from an influx of formation water. Ca+2 can flocculate colloidal clays and precipitate large anionic polymers that contain carboxylate groups, such as an acrylate polymer. On the other hand, some mud types tolerate calcium, in which case calcium is not considered a contaminant.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/calcium_contamination

Total carbonates are measured by the amount of CO2 evolved in the test.,Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/carbonate_test
citric acid,"An organic acid, properly called 2-Hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, with formula C6H8O7. Citric acid is used to reduce the pH of drilling fluids and hence for treatment of cement contamination. It also acts as a polymer stabilizer.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/citric_acid
carbonate ion,"An anion with formula CO3–2. Carbonate chemistry involves a pH-dependent equilibrium between H2O, H+, OH–, CO2, HCO3– and CO3–2. At low pH, carbon dioxide [CO2] dominates. As pH rises from acidic toward neutral, HCO3– ions dominate. As pH rises above neutral, CO3–2 ions dominate. If no component is lost from the system (such as CO2 gas evolving), changing pH up and down continually reverses the relative proportion of the carbonate species. Carbonates play several important roles in water mud chemistry.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/carbonate_ion
cation,A positively charged ion.,Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cation
cavings,"Pieces of rock that came from the wellbore but that were not removed directly by the action of the drill bit.

The shape of the caving can indicate why the rock failure occurred. The term is typically used in the plural form.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cavings
cation exchange capacity,"The quantity of positively charged ions (cations) that a clay mineral or similar material can accommodate on its negatively charged surface, expressed as milli-ion equivalent per 100 g, or more commonly as milliequivalent (meq) per 100 g. Clays are aluminosilicates in which some of the aluminum and silicon ions have been replaced by elements with different valence, or charge. For example, aluminum (Al+++) may be replaced by iron (Fe++) or magnesium (Mg++), leading to a net negative charge. This charge attracts cations when the clay is immersed in an electrolyte such as salty water and causes an electrical double layer. The cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is often expressed in terms of its contribution per unit pore volume, Qv. In formation evaluation, it is the contribution of cation-exchange sites to the formation electrical properties that is important. Various techniques are used to measure CEC in the laboratory, such as wet chemistry, multiple salinity, and membrane potential. Wet chemistry methods, such as conductometric titration, usually involve destruction or alteration of the rock. Although quicker and simpler to perform, they are less representative of electrical properties in situ. The multiple salinity and membrane potential methods are more direct measurements of the effect of CEC on formation resistivity and spontaneous potential.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cation_exchange_capacity
caustic soda,The common name for sodium hydroxide [NaOH]. Caustic soda is used in most water-base muds to increase and maintain pH and alkalinity.

cellulosic polymer,"A drilling-fluid additive used primarily for fluid-loss control, manufactured by reacting natural cellulose with monochloroacetic acid and sodium hydroxide [NaOH] to form CMC sodium salt. Up to 20 wt % of CMC may be NaCl, a by-product of manufacture, but purified grades of CMC contain only small amounts of NaCl. To make CMC, OH groups on the glucose rings of cellulose are ether-linked to carboxymethyl (-OCH2-COO-) groups. (Note the negative charge.) Each glucose ring has three OH groups capable of reaction, degree-of-substitution = 3. Degree of substitution determines water solubility and negativity of the polymer, which influences a CMC's effectiveness as a mud additive. Drilling grade CMCs used in muds typically have degree-of-substitution around 0.80 to 0.96. Carboxymethylcellulose is commonly supplied either as low-viscosity (""CMC-Lo Vis"") or high-viscosity (""CMC-Hi Vis"") grades, both of which have API specifications.

cloud point glycol,"A glycol that is soluble at low temperatures but starts to form micelles (molecular agglomerates), thus becoming cloudy, as the temperature is raised. The temperature at which this phenomenon occurs the cloud point is affected by salinity, being generally lower in more saline fluids. Cloud point glycols are used as shale inhibitors. The purported mechanism is that the glycol clouds out at higher downhole temperatures, coating the surface of clays and preventing hydration.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cloud_point_glycol
cloud point,"The temperature at which a solution of a surfactant or glycol starts to form micelles (molecular agglomerates), thus becoming cloudy. This behavior is characteristic of nonionic surfactants, which are often soluble at low temperatures but ""cloud out"" at some point as the temperature is raised.

chelating agent,"A chemical used to bind metal ions to form a ring structure. Chelating agents stabilize or prevent the precipitation of damaging compounds. In the oil field, chelating agents are used in stimulation treatments and for cleaning surface facilities. They are also used to treat or remove scale or weighting agents in reservoir drilling fluids. During acid or scale-removal treatments, various compounds may be dissolved in the treatment fluid. As the acid reacts and the pH increases, reaction products may precipitate as a gelatinous, insoluble mass. Should this occur within the formation matrix, it is almost impossible to remove and permanent permeability damage may occur. Chelating agents prevent precipitation by keeping ions in a soluble form until the treatment fluid can be flowed back from the formation during cleanup.

dilution water,"Also called make-up water, which is water added to maintain or dilute a water-mud system. The added water may be fresh water, seawater or salt water, as appropriate for the mud. Make-up water volume is an important parameter in a material balance check on solids content and solids removal efficiency for a mud system. The amount of dilution strongly influences mud economics. If soft make-up water is needed, treatments to remove hardness ions should be done prior to adding the water to the mud to avoid clay flocculation and polymer precipitation.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dilution_water
diesel-oil mud,"An oil-base mud with diesel oil as its external phase. Diesel-oil mud is the traditional oil mud and has a history of excellent performance for drilling difficult wells. It has been used because the base oil is low-cost and widely available motor fuel. In-gauge holes can be drilled through all types of shales, salt, gypsum and other difficult strata using diesel-oil mud systems. It is often the mud of choice for drilling high-pressure, high-temperature zones. Diesel-oil muds usually contain from 5 to 40 vol.% emulsified brine water (except those that are specially designed to have none). The water phase usually contains 20 to 40 wt.% dissolved calcium chloride for shale control. Diesel-oil muds have been replaced in land drilling by mineral-oil muds and offshore by synthetic-fluid muds. These newer muds have fewer health, safety and environmental concerns compared to diesel oil.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diesel-oil_mud
differential sticking,"A condition whereby the drillstring cannot be moved (rotated or reciprocated) along the axis of the wellbore. Differential sticking typically occurs when high-contact forces caused by low reservoir pressures, high wellbore pressures, or both, are exerted over a sufficiently large area of the drillstring. Differential sticking is, for most drilling organizations, the greatest drilling problem worldwide in terms of time and financial cost. It is important to note that the sticking force is a product of the differential pressure between the wellbore and the reservoir and the area that the differential pressure is acting upon. This means that a relatively low differential pressure (delta p) applied over a large working area can be just as effective in sticking the pipe as can a high differential pressure applied over a small area.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/differential_sticking

direct-indicating viscometer,"The instrument used to measure viscosity and gel strength of drilling mud. The direct-indicating viscometer is a rotational cylinder and bob instrument, also known as a V-G meter. Two speeds of rotation, 300 and 600 rpm, are available in all instruments, but some are 6- or variable-speed. It is called ""direct-indicating"" because at a given speed, the dial reading is a true centipoise viscosity. For example, at 300 rpm, the dial reading (511 sec-1) is a true viscosity. Bingham plastic rheological parameters are easily calculated from direct-indicating viscometer readings: PV (in units of cP) = 600 dial - 300 dial and YP (in units of lbm/100 ft2) = 300 dial - PV. Gel strength is also directly read as dial readings in oilfield units of lbm/100 ft2.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/direct-indicating_viscometer

DD,A surfactant-type mud additive intended to prevent formation shales and clays from sticking to the drilling assembly and also to prevent gumbo shale from agglomerating and plugging the annulus and flowlines. Some DDs are claimed to be mud lubricants that lessen the torque and drag of the drillstring as it is rotated and moved up and down in the hole.,Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dd
diesel-oil plug,"Another term for gunk plug, a slurry that consists of bentonite, cement or polymers mixed into an oil; bentonite in diesel oil is commonly used as a gunk plug. A small batch of the slurry is pumped down a well that has lost circulation to seal the leaky zone. The gunk plug may or may not be squeezed by pressure into the zone. Water downhole interacts with the bentonite, cement or polymers to make a sticky gunk.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diesel-oil_plug
differential pressure sticking,"A condition whereby the drillstring cannot be moved (rotated or reciprocated) along the axis of the wellbore.

deflocculated mud,"A clay-based water mud that has had its viscosity reduced with a chemical treatment; incorrectly called a ""dispersed"" mud. The chemical used is a deflocculant, not a dispersant. A well-known and effective clay deflocculant is lignosulfonate. The mud, after being deflocculated, usually shows much improved filter-cake qualities with lower yield point and gel strengths. Filter-cake quality is improved because when clays are deflocculated, the platelets become detached from each other and can lie flat to form a thin, low-permeability filter cake. Lowering yield point and gel strength may not always be desired and can be adjusted by the amount of deflocculant added in each treatment. If yield point and gels are lowered too far, suspension and cutting capacity of the mud are impaired.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/deflocculated_mud
defoamer,"A mud additive used to lower interfacial tension so that trapped gas will readily escape from mud. Mechanical degassing equipment is commonly used along with defoamer. Octyl alcohol, aluminum stearate, various glycols, silicones and sulfonated hydrocarbons are used as defoamers.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/defoamer
deflocculant,"A thinning agent used to reduce viscosity or prevent flocculation; incorrectly called a ""dispersant."" Most deflocculants are low-molecular-weight anionic polymers that neutralize positive charges on clay edges.

derrickman,"One of the rig crew members who gets his name from the fact that he works on a platform attached to the derrick or mast, typically 85 ft [26 m] above the rig floor, during trips. On small land drilling crews, the derrickman is second in rank to the driller. Larger offshore crews may have an assistant driller between the derrickman and the driller. In a typical trip out of the hole (TOH), the derrickman wears a special safety harness that enables him to lean out from the work platform (called the monkeyboard) to reach the drillpipe in the center of the derrick or mast, throw a line around the pipe and pull it back into its storage location (the fingerboards) until it is time to run the pipe back into the well. In terms of skill, physical exertion and perceived danger, a derrickman has one of the most demanding jobs on the rig crew. Some modern drilling rigs have automated pipe-handling equipment such that the derrickman controls the machinery rather than physically handling the pipe. In an emergency, the derrickman can quickly reach the ground by an escape line often called the Geronimo line.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/derrickman

relative filtrate volume,"Quantity that is double the filtrate volume collected from a filtration test between 7.5 to 30 minutes. This ignores the spurt of filtrate that comes out of the filter press before a cake is established. Relative filtrate volume is used to evaluate certain mud materials. Relative filtrate volume can be expressed as Vrel, = (V30 - V7.5) x 2. Static filtration theory holds that filtrate volume increases as the square root of time. Thus, the volume from 0 to 7.5 minutes should be the same as from 7.5 to 30 minutes in the case of no spurt loss in the first interval. Because spurt often occurs in the 0 to 7.5 minutes, those data can be ignored by doubling the volume in the second interval.

low-solids mud,"A mud that has fewer solids than conventional clay-based muds of the same density and similar use. Low-solids mud design and maintenance is accomplished primarily by substituting one or more polymers for the ordinary bentonite clay. Viscosity can be obtained either entirely by polymers or by using a premium quality (nontreated) bentonite along with the appropriate extender polymer. Together, these give rheology comparable to that of a higher concentration of ordinary bentonite. Polyanionic cellulose (PAC) may be needed for fluid-loss control. XC polymer can be effective for cuttings carrying. By combining premium bentonite and the right extender polymer, PAC and XC polymer, solids can be kept low, if solids control is required.

lost circulation,"The reduced or total absence of fluid flow up the annulus when fluid is pumped through the drillstring. Though the definitions of different operators vary, this reduction of flow may generally be classified as seepage (less than 20 bbl/hr [3 m3/hr]), partial lost returns (greater than 20 bbl/hr [3 m3/hr] but still some returns), and total lost returns (where no fluid comes out of the annulus). In this severe latter case, the hole may not remain full of fluid even if the pumps are turned off. If the hole does not remain full of fluid, the vertical height of the fluid column is reduced and the pressure exerted on the open formations is reduced. This in turn can result in another zone flowing into the wellbore, while the loss zone is taking mud, or even a catastrophic loss of well control. Even in the two less severe forms, the loss of fluid to the formation represents a financial loss that must be dealt with, and the impact of which is directly tied to the per barrel cost of the drilling fluid and the loss rate over time.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/lost_circulation

isomerized olefin,"A synthetic hydrocarbon liquid made by the polymerization of ethylene, H2C=CH2. IOs are one of several synthetic fluids that have recently been used as base for synthetic-base muds and in other applications where refined oils might otherwise be used except for HSE concerns. IOs are linear structures that have their olefin double bond in the center of the chain length. They are made by isomerization of linear alphaolefins (LAO), which have their double bond at the end of the chain. Because the olefin bond is in the central area of the chain, the physical properties of IOs are different (for example, they are generally lower viscosity) compared with the LAOs from which they are made.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/isomerized_olefin
interfacial tension,"A property of the interface between two immiscible phases. When the phases are both liquid, it is termed interfacial tension; when one of the phases is air, it is termed surface tension. Interfacial tension is the Gibbs free energy per unit area of interface at fixed temperature and pressure. Interfacial tension occurs because a molecule near an interface has different molecular interactions than an equivalent molecule within the bulk fluid. Surfactant molecules preferentially position themselves at the interface and thereby lower the interfacial tension.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/interfacial_tension

oil-base mud,"An invert-emulsion mud, or an emulsion whose continuous phase is oil. In the past, the term referred to an oil mud containing less than about 5 vol.% water. This definition, at the time, distinguished mud with less than 5 vol.% water from invert-emulsion oil muds, which had more than 5 vol.% water.

oil-mud emulsifier,"A chemical used in preparation and maintenance of an oil- or synthetic-base drilling fluid that forms a water-in-oil emulsion (invert emulsion). An oil-mud emulsifier lowers the interfacial tension between oil and water, which allows stable emulsions with small drops to be formed. Historically, oil-mud emulsifiers have been classified as primary and secondary. Secondary emulsifiers are generally not used alone to make a stable oil mud. Emulsifiers can be calcium fatty-acid soaps made from various fatty acids and lime, or derivatives such as amides, amines, amidoamines and imidazolines made by reactions of fatty acids and various ethanolamine compounds. These emulsifiers surround water droplets, like an encapsulating film, with the fatty acid component extending into the oil phase. Emulsifier molecules that cannot fit around drops form clusters (micelles) in the oil phase or adsorb onto solids. Oil-mud emulsion drops each behave like a small osmotic cell. The emulsifier around the drops acts like a semipermeable membrane through which water can move but ions cannot pass. Thus, oil muds have the special capability (which water muds do not have) to control water transfer to and from the drops simply by adjusting salinity within the water phase of the oil mud.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oil-mud_emulsifier

Their solutions are buffers in the 4.6 to 12 pH range. TSP is an excellent degreaser. All will precipitate hardness ions such as calcium. Polyphosphates are polymers made from various orthophosphates by dehydration with heat. Sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) is a clay deflocculant and treatment for cement contamination. For clay deflocculation, polyphosphates are limited by the temperature at which they hydrolyze back to orthophosphates, although several that performed up to 280°F [138°C] have been documented in the literature (see reference).

potassium mud,"A class of muds that contain potassium ion (K+) dissolved in the water phase. Potassium muds are the most widely accepted water mud system for drilling water-sensitive shales, especially hard, brittle shales. K+ ions attach to clay surfaces and lend stability to shale exposed to drilling fluids by the bit. The ions also help hold the cuttings together, minimizing dispersion into finer particles. The presence of Na+ ions counteracts the benefits of K+ ions and should be minimized by using fresh water (not sea water) for make-up water. With time, Na+, Ca+2 and other ions accumulate from ion exchange with clays, making the mud less effective, but regular treatment to remove Ca+2 improves polymer function. Potassium chloride, KCl, is the most widely used potassium source. Others are potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, potassium lignite, potassium hydroxide and potassium salt of PHPA. Use of bentonite clay is restricted because of its strong affinity for K+. Instead, various polymers are used. XC polymer and PHPA are used for rheology. For fluid-loss control, mixtures of starch and polyanionic cellulose are often used. CM starch, HP starch, carboxymethylcellulose and sodium polyacrylate (SPA) are also used. PHPA is widely used for shale encapsulation. Potassium, lime and starch-like polymers have also been used as potassium mud systems. Although three API methods exist for determining the K+ ion concentration, the centrifuge method (for K+ >5000 mg/L) is the most accepted field method, and essential for daily monitoring of potassium in a mud. Regular additions of potassium salt maintain shale stability. K+ ion is rapidly consumed while drilling shallow, soft and highly dispersive (gumbo) shales, but maintaining sufficient K+ ion to stabilize gumbo can become expensive when drilling large holes. Researchers, notably Dr. Dennis O'Brien and Dr. Martin Chenevert (while at Exxon Production Research), evaluated different shales, their clay mineralogy and the concentration of K+ needed to stabilize them. Potassium muds above about 1 wt.% K+ ion usually fail the mysid shrimp (US EPA) bioassay test. Therefore, K-muds currently find low acceptance in offshore drilling in USA waters.

IOs are one of several synthetic fluids that have recently been used as base for synthetic-base muds and in other applications where refined oils might otherwise be used except for HSE concerns. IOs are linear structures that have their olefin double bond in the center of the chain length. They are made by isomerization of linear alphaolefins (LAO), which have their double bond at the end of the chain. Because the olefin bond is in the central area of the chain, the physical properties of IOs are different (for example, they are generally lower viscosity) compared with the LAOs from which they are made.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/polyolefin

polyacrylate,"Linear, anionic polymer made from the monomer acrylic acid, CH2=CHCOO- H+. The acrylic acid groups are evenly spaced along the chain. Acrylic acid polymer neutralized with NaOH is sodium polyacrylate (SPA). Polyacrylates are best utilized in soft water with low salinity to achieve the best dispersion and full chain elongation. Even low concentrations of hardness ions, for example, Ca+2, precipitate polyacrylates. Low molecular-weight polyacrylates are used as clay deflocculants. High molecular weight polymers are used for fluid-loss control and as a clay extender. As an extender, SPA is added to bentonite at the grinding plant. It is also used at the rig in low-solids mud. Divalent cations can negate its benefits as a clay extender. SPA is highly efficient when used to flocculate colloids in native-solids muds, clear-water muds and wastewater cleanup.

potassium ion,"The ion of potassium, K+. There are tests used to monitor high (>5,000 mg/L) or low (<5,000 mg/L) potassium ion concentration in water-based muds. The test for high concentration, as specified by the API, is based on the insolubility of potassium perchlorate. A volume of mud filtrate is mixed with an excess of NaClO4 in a centrifuge tube. White KClO4 is precipitated by the reaction. After the tube has spun in a centrifuge to settle the white sediment in the tube, the amount of precipitate is read and compared to a calibration chart that relates sediment to concentration of K+ in the filtrate sample. The test to monitor low potassium ion concentration in water-base muds, as prescribed by API, is a titration procedure using quaternary ammonium salt solution (QAS) as reagent. Potassium ion is first precipitated as the tetraphenylborate (TPB) salt by adding an excess of sodium tetraphenylborate.

quebracho,"A powdered form of tannic acid extract from the bark of the quebracho tree, used as a high-pH and lime mud deflocculant. It was in widespread use until the 1950s, at which time lignosulfonate became widely available and performed the same function better and cheaper than quebracho. High pH was needed to neutralize tannic acids to form the tannates, which are red. The oilfield name red mud was applied to tannate-dispersed muds.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/q/quebracho

In fact, dilution of unweighted muds is highly economical.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/unweighted_mud
undersaturated fluid,"A solution that could contain more solute than is presently dissolved in it. In brines, an undersaturated solution will not form crystals as easily as if it were saturated or supersaturated. In saltwater muds, an under-saturated fluid is used to allow salt to leach into the mud, keeping the hole from closing in on the drilling assembly. For moisture in air, a relative humidity of less than 100% is under-saturated.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/undersaturated_fluid
U-tube effect,"In a U-tube manometer, the height of one leg of fluid changed by altering the density of some of the fluid in the other leg. In a well with drillpipe in the hole, the string of drillpipe is one leg and the annulus between the drillpipe and the wellbore is the other. If a denser mud goes into the drillpipe, mud flows up the annulus, and vice versa. The practice of putting a dense slugging pill in the drillpipe in order to pull a dry string makes use of the U-tube effect.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/u-tube_effect

vapor pressure,"The pressure exerted by a vapor escaping from a liquid. It quantifies the tendency of molecules to enter the gaseous phase. The vapor pressure of water increases as temperature increases and reaches one atmosphere pressure (760 mm Hg or 14.7 psia) at the boiling point (100 or 212 degF). The activity of an aqueous solution is the ratio of vapor pressures: aw = p/po, where p = vapor pressure of a solution and po is vapor pressure of pure water. Since this is a ratio of vapor pressures, activity is not a strong function of temperature.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/vapor_pressure
viscosity,"A property of fluids and slurries that indicates their resistance to flow, defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate.

Poise is the unit for viscosity, equivalent to dyne-sec/cm2. Because one poise represents a high viscosity, 1/100 poise, or one centipoise (cP), is used for mud measurements. One centipoise equals one millipascal-second. Viscosity must have a stated or an understood shear rate  to be meaningful. Measurement temperature also must be stated or understood.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/viscosity
viscosity and gel-strength test,"Measurement of the viscosity and gel strength of a drilling fluid. The gel strength is the shear stress measured at low shear rate after a mud has set quiescently for a period of time (10 seconds and 10 minutes in the standard API procedure, although measurements after 30 minutes or 16 hours may also be made). Viscosity is measured using a Marsh funnel, a conical-shaped funnel, fitted with a small-bore tube on the bottom end through which mud flows under a gravity head. A screen over the top removes large particles that might plug the tube. In the test standardized by API for evaluating water-base and oil-base muds, the funnel viscosity measurement is the time (in seconds) required for one quart of mud to flow out of a Marsh funnel into a graduated mud cup. Funnel viscosity is reported in seconds (for a quart). Water exits the funnel in about 26 seconds. This test was one of the earliest mud measurements for field use. Simple, quick and fool-proof, it still serves as a useful indicator of change in the mud by comparing mud-in and mud-out sample funnel viscosities.

wall sticking,"Also known as differential sticking, a condition whereby the drillstring cannot be moved (rotated or reciprocated) along the axis of the wellbore. Differential sticking typically occurs when high-contact forces caused by low reservoir pressures, high wellbore pressures, or both, are exerted over a sufficiently large area of the drillstring. Differential sticking is, for most drilling organizations, the greatest drilling problem worldwide in terms of time and financial cost. It is important to note that the sticking force is a product of the differential pressure between the wellbore and the reservoir and the area that the differential pressure is acting upon. This means that a relatively low differential pressure (delta p) applied over a large working area can be just as effective in sticking the pipe as can a high differential pressure applied over a small area.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wall_sticking
wall cake,"The residue deposited on a permeable medium when a slurry, such as a drilling fluid, is forced against the medium under a pressure. Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filter-cake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filter cake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filter cake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wall_cake

activity of aqueous solutions,"The escaping tendency, or vapor pressure, of water molecules in an aqueous solution compared with that of pure water, typically abbreviated aw. Activity is expressed mathematically as the ratio of two vapor pressures: aw = p/po, where p is vapor pressure of the solution and po is vapor pressure of pure water. The ratio ranges from near 0 to 1.0 and corresponds to percent relative humidity (% RH) of air in equilibrium with the aqueous solution. For pure water, aw = po/po = 1.00 and RH = 100%. By increasing the concentration of salt (or other solutes) in the solution, aw decreases, because vapor pressure of the solution decreases. However, aw never reaches zero. Known-activity, saturated-salt solutions are used to calibrate RH meters. Measuring RH of air above an oil mud is a simple way to measure the activity (salinity) of its water phase. Adjusting the salinity of the water phase is a way to control movement of water into or out of shales that are being drilled with an oil mud.

acrylate polymer,"Linear, anionic polymer made from the monomer acrylic acid, CH2=CHCOO– H+. The acrylic acid groups are evenly spaced along the chain. Acrylic acid polymer neutralized with NaOH is sodium polyacrylate (SPA). Polyacrylates are best utilized in soft water with low salinity to achieve the best dispersion and full chain elongation. Even low concentrations of hardness ions, for example, Ca+2, precipitate polyacrylates. Low molecular-weight polyacrylates are used as clay deflocculants. High molecular weight polymers are used for fluid-loss control and as a clay extender. As an extender, SPA is added to bentonite at the grinding plant. It is also used at the rig in low-solids mud. Divalent cations can negate its benefits as a clay extender. SPA is highly efficient when used to flocculate colloids in native-solids muds, clear-water muds and wastewater cleanup. The polymer chain links together colloidal solids that can be removed by gravity settling in shallow pits or by applying hydrocyclone, centrifuge or filtration techniques.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/acrylate_polymer

acrylamido-methyl-propane sulfonate polymer,"A copolymer of 2-acrylamido-2methyl propane sulfonate and acrylamide. AMPS polymers are highly water-soluble anionic additives designed for high-salinity and high-temperature water-mud applications. (Alkyl-substituted acrylamide can be used instead of ordinary acrylamide, which lessens its vulnerability to hydrolysis at high temperature and high pH.) Polymers from 0.75 to 1.5 MM molecular weight are suggested for fluid-loss control in these difficult muds.

acrylamide acrylate polymer,"A linear copolymer of acrylate (anionic) and acrylamide (nonionic) monomers, also called partially-hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PHPA). The ratio of acrylic acid to acrylamide groups on the polymer chain can be varied in manufacturing, as can molecular weight. Another variable is the base used to neutralize the acrylic acid groups, usually NaOH or KOH, or sometimes NH4OH. A concentration of approximately 10 to 30% acrylate groups provides optimal anionic characteristics for most drilling applications. High-molecular weight PHPA is used as a shale-stabilizing polymer in PHPA mud systems. It is also used as clay extender, either dry-mixed into clay or added at the rig to a low-bentonite mud. PHPA can also be used to flocculate colloidal solids during clear-water drilling and for wastewater cleanup. Low molecular-weight PHPA is a clay deflocculant.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/acrylamide_acrylate_polymer
asphaltic mud additive,"A group of high-viscosity or solid hydrocarbons obtained from naturally occurring deposits or from the residue of petroleum refining, commonly used as additives for oil-based and water-based muds.

Attapulgite and sepiolite have similar structures and both can be used in saltwater mud to provide low-shear rate viscosity for lifting cuttings out of the annulus and for barite suspension. Attapulgite and sepiolite are sometimes called ""salt gel."" Attapulgite has no capability to control the filtration properties of the mud. For use as an oil mud additive, the clay is coated with quaternary amine, which makes it oil-dispersible and provides gel structure but does not improve the filter cake, unlike organophilic bentonite clay.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/attapulgite

shear rate,"The velocity gradient measured across the diameter of a fluid-flow channel, be it a pipe, annulus or other shape. Shear rate is the rate of change of velocity at which one layer of fluid passes over an adjacent layer. As an example, consider that a fluid is placed between two parallel plates that are 1.0 cm apart, the upper plate moving at a velocity of 1.0 cm/sec and the lower plate fixed. The fluid layer at the lower plate is not moving and the layer nearest the top plate is moving at 1.0 cm/sec. Halfway between the plate, a layer is moving at 0.5 cm/sec. The velocity gradient is the rate of change of velocity with distance from the plates. This simple case shows the uniform velocity gradient with shear rate (v1 - v2)/h = shear rate = (cm/sec)/(cm/1) = 1/sec. Hence, shear rate units are reciprocal seconds.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shear_rate
siderite,"A mineral composed of ferrous carbonate, FeCO3, and having 3.8 g/cm3 specific gravity.

Such tests are performed under controlled environmental conditions and duration. Bioassay tests of drilling fluids are required by governmental agencies throughout the world prior to discharge of mud or cuttings. The organisms used in bioassays are those found in the area that would be most affected by contact with the proposed drilling fluid. The dosage of interest is typically the lethal concentration, known as LC50, that will kill 50% of the population of organisms in a given period of time. Chronic bioassay tests indicate sublethal effects, such as changes in growth or reproduction of the organism over a longer period of time.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shrimp_test
silica layer,"One of the layers that constitute the atomic structure of the clay group of layered silicate minerals. The structure of these minerals can consist of two, three or four layers. The silica layer is a plane of silicon dioxide tetrahedra (silicon at the center and oxygen at all four corners of the tetrahedron). Another structural layer is a plane of aluminum hydroxide octahedra (aluminum at the center and hydroxides at all six corners). The tetrahedral and octahedral layers fit one on top of the other, with oxygen atoms being shared as oxide and hydroxide groups.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/silica_layer
silicate mud,"A type of shale-inhibitive water base drilling fluid that contains sodium silicate or potassium silicate polymeric ions. These ions adsorb on the shale surface and form a semipermeable osmotic membrane that prevents the transport of water and ions internal to the shale structure. This physicochemical barrier helps improve wellbore stability and provides in-gauge holes through troublesome shale sections that otherwise might require a nonaqueous drilling fluid. Silicate-gel drilling muds were first used in the 1930s to control problematic shales. In the 1990s, silicate nondispersed polymer drilling fluids were reintroduced to provide a high-performance shale-inhibitive water-base fluid, as an alternative to oil-base fluids. The highly inhibitive silicate fluid not only provides wellbore stability but also improves solids control performance with minimal environmental impact.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/silicate_mud

Montmorillonite is a well-known smectite clay mineral to those working in drilling and drilling fluids. Its sodium form, bentonite, is a widely-used water mud additive. It is also used as an oil-mud additive when made oil-dispersible by surface treatment. Smectite clays that occur naturally in shales cause wellbore and mud-control problems due to their hydrational swelling and colloidal dispersion characteristics.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/smectite_clay
stress corrosion cracking,"A form of corrosion in which susceptible types of metals will break by a combination of stress within the metal and the specific type of corrosion. Sulfide corrosion of ferrous alloys and chloride corrosion of stainless steels are two common type of SCC. When high-strength steel remains in contact with hydrogen sulfide (or sulfide ion) in a water-mud environment, sulfide SCC may occur. Tool joints, hardened parts of blowout preventers and valve trim are particularly susceptible to brittle failure caused by sulfide SCC. For this reason, along with toxicity risks of hydrogen sulfide gas, it is essential that water muds be kept entirely free of soluble sulfides and especially hydrogen sulfide at low pH.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stress_corrosion_cracking
styrene,"The compound C6H5-HC=CH2, also known as styrolene, cinnamene and phenethylene. The phenyl radical, C6H5-, replaces one of the hydrogen atoms on ethylene. Styrene polymers are analogous to vinyl polymers in structure except that phenyl radicals replace the corresponding H atom.

suspended solids,"Dispersed particles in a slurry that can be separated by filtration and are not dissolved. In the water, oil and solids test (retort test), the retort solids are divided into two types, dissolved and suspended solids. Suspended solids are the particulates. In calculating solids content of water- or oil-base muds, suspended solids are divided into high-gravity and low-gravity solids (HGS and LGS). LGS are sometimes further subdivided into active (clay) and inactive solids.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/suspended_solids
sulfide test,"A quantitative analysis of sulfides in the drilling fluid. Specific test methods have been published by API. The oil-mud procedure analyzes active sulfides and uses whole mud samples, whereas the water-base drilling fluid procedure tests filtrate. The instrument used is called a Garrett gas train (GGT), a clear, plastic block (2.5 in. x 4 in. x 6 in.) that contains three interconnected chambers. A carrier gas is used to flow an inert gas through the chambers. The sample is placed in chamber #1 and is acidified to release sulfides as H2S (and carbonates as CO2). The appropriate Draeger tube is used to measure the effluent gas that is evolved from the sample. The device is named after Bob Garrett, who invented it while at Exxon Production Research.

sulfonated polystyrene-maleic anhydride copolymer,"A copolymer of polystyrene (containing sulfonate groups on the ring) and anhydrous maleic acid (a di-hydroxy acid). The sulfonated ring-structure polymer component is anionic and usually low to moderate in chain length and molecular weight. As such, with negative groups on the structure (amount of negativity depending on degree of sulfonation), it is used as a clay deflocculant for bentonite-based water mud. It is especially stable to temperature up to around 400°F [204°C], and often used in high-density muds to stabilize rheology. Lignosulfonate is used for this purpose up to about 300°F [149°C] and then SSMA polymeric deflocculant is often phased into the mud system for drilling deeper and hotter zones.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sulfonated_polystyrene-maleic_anhydride_copolymer
sulfide scavenger,"A chemical that removes all three soluble sulfide species, H2S, S-2 and HS-, and forms a product that is nonhazardous and noncorrosive. Zinc compounds are commonly used to precipitate ZnS and decrease the concentration of all three sulfides that are in equilibrium in a solution to a very low concentration. For water mud, zinc basic carbonate, and, for oil mud, zinc oxide, are recognized to be effective sulfide scavengers. Oxidation of sulfides to form other types of sulfur compounds will remove sulfides from a mud, but slowly and with less certainty.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sulfide_scavenger
sulfide,"A compound of sulfur that contains the S-2 ion. H2S is the gaseous and highly toxic molecular form often found in the subsurface. Sulfide, S-2, and bisulfide, HS-, are the corresponding ionic forms. Sulfides can be generated from soluble iron sulfide minerals or from sulfate-reducing bacteria. The term ""active sulfide"" is used to denote compounds that revert to H2S gas when acidified with 2-molar citric acid solution, as opposed to inert sulfides, which are stable. Active sulfides include calcium sulfide and bisulfide formed when H2S reacts with lime in an oil mud. Their accumulation constitutes a safety concern at the rig because of the risk of reverting to H2S gas should an acidic influx occur. They may be converted to inert sulfides by adding zinc oxide.

sulfate-reducing bacteria,"A common anaerobic bacterium, commonly abbreviated SRB, that can convert sulfate ions, SO4-2, into S-2 and HS-, with the concomitant oxidation of a carbon source. The lignite, lignin, tannins, cellulose, starches and fatty acids found in many mud systems are carbon food sources for SRB. Where mud is stored, precautions should always be taken when handling or reconditioning water muds containing lignosulfonates, gypsum (sulfate sources) and starches, cellulose, xanthan gum and lignite (food sources). These muds can harbor SRB and can have high sulfide accumulations. Mud filtrate should be tested with the Garrett Gas Train to determine sulfide concentration in a stored mud, followed by treatments with caustic soda to raise pH and zinc-based scavengers to remove sulfides as ZnS. Before storage of mud, treatment with a bactericide can inhibit SRB growth. Also, circulating mud from time to time, with air entrainment, can retard development of anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic bacteria can convert the sulfate or sulfite present in water handling facilities to hydrogen sulfide [H2S]. This by-product, combined with iron, can form iron sulfide, a scale that is very difficult to remove. SRB occur naturally in surface waters, including seawater. Bacteria accumulation can lead to pitting of steel, and the buildup of H2S increases the corrosiveness of the water, thus increasing the possibility of hydrogen blistering or sulfide stress cracking.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sulfate-reducing_bacteria
sulfide stress cracking,"A type of spontaneous brittle failure in steels and other high-strength alloys when they are in contact with moist hydrogen sulfide and other sulfidic environments. Tool joints, hardened parts of blowout preventers and valve trim are particularly susceptible. For this reason, along with toxicity risks of hydrogen sulfide gas, it is essential that water muds be kept entirely free of soluble sulfides and especially hydrogen sulfide at low pH. Sulfide stress cracking is also called hydrogen sulfide cracking, sulfide cracking, sulfide corrosion cracking and sulfide stress-corrosion cracking. The variation of the name is due to the lack of agreement in the mechanism of failure. Some researchers consider sulfide-stress cracking a type of stress-corrosion cracking, while others consider it a type of hydrogen embrittlement.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sulfide_stress_cracking

surface tension,"Surface free energy that exists between a liquid and air. Surface tension can be observed as a curved meniscus in a small tube of the liquid. This energy barrier prevents a liquid (such as water) from spontaneously mixing with air to form a foam. To make a foam, as used for a drilling fluid, the liquid's surface tension must be lowered by adding a third component (a foamer) that accumulates at the interface. Foam preparation usually requires mechanical energy to break up the bulk liquid into thin films around each gas bubble.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/surface_tension
SPA,"Abbreviation for sodium polyacrylate. SPA is the result of neutralizing a linear, anionic polymer made from the monomer acrylic acid, CH2=CHCOO- H+, with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Polyacrylates are best utilized in soft water with low salinity to achieve the best dispersion and full chain elongation. Even low concentrations of hardness ions, for example, Ca+2, precipitate polyacrylates. Low molecular-weight polyacrylates are used as clay deflocculants. High molecular weight polymers are used for fluid-loss control and as a clay extender. As an extender, SPA is added to bentonite at the grinding plant. It is also used at the rig in low-solids mud. Divalent cations can negate its benefits as a clay extender. SPA is highly efficient when used to flocculate colloids in native-solids muds, clear-water muds and wastewater cleanup. The polymer chain links together colloidal solids that can be removed by gravity settling in shallow pits or by applying hydrocyclone, centrifuge or filtration techniques.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spa
sour gas,"A general term for those gases that are acidic either alone or when associated with water. Two sour gases associated with oil and gas drilling and production are hydrogen sulfide, H2S, and carbon dioxide, CO2. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, generated by oxidation of certain sulfur- or nitrogen-bearing materials, are also in this category but not found in the anaerobic conditions of the subsurface.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sour_gas
shearometer,"An instrument used together with a set of weights to conduct a shear-strength measurement test. This test procedure published by the API measures the shear strength of a mud (lbf/100 ft2 or kPa). The typical use for this test is for evaluation of a static-aged mud sample left at high temperature for several hours. The shearometer tube is placed on the surface of the gelled mud and weights are applied until the tube sinks to a marked depth. The applied weight indicates shear strength of the mud sample.

sodium chromate,"A sodium salt, Na2CrO4, in which chromium atoms are in the plus-6 valence state. Chromium compounds of various types have been used in lignite and lignosulfonate and other mud additives to enhance thermal stability. Since the late 1970s, they are prohibited in muds to be discarded offshore and in other environmentally sensitive areas of the US.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sodium_chromate
sodium bicarbonate,"A chemical with the formula NaHCO3. It is called bicarb at the drilling rig and is used to treat cement contamination in water mud. When cement hydrates, substantial amounts of lime, Ca(OH)2, are produced. As the cement sets, less free lime is available. When partially set cement is drilled with a water mud, Ca+2 and OH- ions are leached into the mud, often causing problems associated with clay flocculation and polymer precipitation. Bicarb can be added, either as a pretreatment or over a period of time, to remove the Ca+2 in the form of insoluble CaCO3 while simultaneously neutralizing OH- ions with the H+ ion in the bicarb molecule.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sodium_bicarbonate
shear-strength measurement test,"A test procedure published by the API that specifies the use of a shearometer tube and a set of weights to measure the shear strength of a mud (lbf/100 ft2 or kPa).

shaly,"Containing shale, a fine-grained, fissile, detrital sedimentary rock formed by consolidation of clay- and silt-sized particles into thin, relatively impermeable layers. It is the most abundant sedimentary rock. Shale can include relatively large amounts of organic material compared with other rock types and thus has potential to become a rich hydrocarbon source rock, even though a typical shale contains just 1% organic matter. Its typical fine grain size and lack of permeability, a consequence of the alignment of its platy or flaky grains, allow shale to form a good cap rock for hydrocarbon traps. Gas shows from shales during drilling have led some shales to be targeted as potential gas reservoirs. Various clay types and volumes influence the quality of the reservoir from a petrophysical and geomechanical perspective. The quality of shale reservoirs depends on their thickness and extent, organic content, thermal maturity, depth and pressure, fluid saturations, and permeability, among other factors.",Adjective,"Geology, Shale Gas",https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shaly

sloughing shale,"A fine-grained, impermeable, sedimentary rock composed of clays and other minerals, usually with a high percentage of quartz. Shale is the most common, and certainly the most troublesome, rock type that must be drilled in order to reach oil and gas deposits. The characteristic that makes shales most troublesome to drillers is its water sensitivity, due in part to its clay content and the ionic composition of the clay. For this reason, oil-base drilling fluids are the mud of choice to drill the most water-sensitive shales.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sloughing_shale

sheen test,"A test intended to indicate the presence of free oil when drilling fluid, drilled cuttings, deck drainage, well treatment fluids, completion and workover fluids, produced water or sand or excess cement slurry are discharged into offshore waters. Two types of sheen tests are mandated by EPA under NPDES permits. The visual sheen test consists of an observation made when surface and atmospheric conditions permit watching the ocean water for a sheen around the point where the discharge entered the water. When the conditions do not permit visual observations, a static sheen test is mandated by NPDES permits and the protocol published by US EPA. This test uses sea water in a shallow pan (not more than 30 cm deep) with 1000 cm2 surface area. Either 15 cm3 of fresh mud or 15 g fresh cuttings are injected below the surface of the water. An observer watches for up to 1.0 hour for a silvery, metallic, colored or iridescent sheen. If sheen covers 50% of the area, the mud or cuttings cannot be discharged.

sand test,"A test to determine the volume percent of solids in a mud that are retained on 200-mesh screen. A glass, sand-content tube with a tapered lower end and a 200-mesh screen are used in the test. The test measures percent solids above 74 micrometers, which include those that could be abrasive to pumps and piping. When performed according to the API protocol for water-base muds, the sand-content tube is filled to the first mark with mud. Water is added to the next mark and the tube is shaken. The diluted slurry is poured through the 200-mesh screen, discarding the liquid. The screen is washed and the residue on the screen is poured back into the tube. Volume percent ""sand"" is measured from divisions on the tapered tube.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sand_test

If a contaminant is harmful at very low concentration, a scavenger must be able to remove the contaminant to an even lower concentration to ensure safety.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/scavenger
SCC,"A form of corrosion in which susceptible types of metals will break by a combination of stress within the metal and the specific type of corrosion. Sulfide corrosion of ferrous alloys and chloride corrosion of stainless steels are two common type of SCC. When high-strength steel remains in contact with hydrogen sulfide (or sulfide ion) in a water-mud environment, sulfide SCC may occur. Tool joints, hardened parts of blowout preventers and valve trim are particularly susceptible to brittle failure caused by sulfide SCC. For this reason, along with toxicity risks of hydrogen sulfide gas, it is essential that water muds be kept entirely free of soluble sulfides and especially hydrogen sulfide at low pH.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/scc
saturated solution,A solution that contains as much dissolved materials as it can hold at a given temperature.

sand trap,"A small pit, typically located immediately after the shaker screens, which is used as a settling pit to separate coarser solids that accidentally bypass the shakers. Mud enters the pit at one side and exits via an overflow at the other. Sand traps are dumped periodically to remove the settled solids, or alternatively the contents can be processed over a fine screen or with a centrifuge.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sand_trap
saltwater mud,"A water mud containing varying amounts of dissolved sodium chloride, NaCl, as a major component. Undissolved salt may also be present in saturated salt muds to increase density beyond 10 lbm/gal or to act as a bridging agent over permeable zones. Starch and starch derivatives for fluid-loss control and xanthan gums for hole-cleaning are among the few highly effective additives for saltwater muds. Attapulgite and sepiolite are used in saltwater muds only for cuttings lifting. The primary use of saltwater mud is to drill salt strata that are prone to dissolution when exposed to other types of drilling fluid. A saturated salt mud is used to drill salt to prevent hole enlargement. In hot, plastic, salt zones, the hole may close inward unless extremely high mud weight is maintained. As an alternative to high mud weight, maintaining undersaturation in the fluid allows controlled leaching to offset hole closure by plastic flow. Sized salt particles in saturated saltwater muds are used, along with polymers, to bridge over permeable production zones. The salt can be removed later with a water flush. Salt solids can increase density beyond 10 lbm/gal, up to about 13 lbm/gal, if needed.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/saltwater_mud
saltwater flow,"An influx of formation water, usually salty and sometimes hard, into the mud in the wellbore. Saltwater flows contaminate freshwater or seawater muds, making it expensive, difficult and time-consuming to regain the mud properties. Influxes pose a lesser problem for saltwater muds. Saltwater contamination flocculates the bentonite clay in fresh- or seawater muds. Flocculated, thick, filter cake on a permeable zone frequently results in differential-pressure sticking.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/saltwater_flow
sack,"A unit of measure for portland cement. In the United States, a sack refers the amount of cement that occupies a bulk volume of 1.0 ft3.

sag,"Settling of particles in the annulus of a well, which can occur when the mud is static or being circulated. Because of the combination of secondary flow and gravitational forces, weighting materials can settle (sag) in a flowing mud in a high-angle well. If settling is prolonged, the upper part of a wellbore will lose mud density, which lessens the hydrostatic pressure in the hole, so an influx (a kick) of formation fluid can enter the well.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sag
sequestering agent,"A chemical whose molecular structure can envelop and hold a certain type of ion in a stable and soluble complex. Divalent cations, such as hardness ions, form stable and soluble complex structures with several types of sequestering chemicals. When held inside the complex, the ions have a limited ability to react with other ions, clays or polymers. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a well-known sequestering agent for the hardness ions, such as Ca+2, and is the reagent solution used in the hardness test protocol published by API. Polyphosphates can also sequester hardness ions. The addition of sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) to a cement-contaminated mud renders the calcium ions essentially nonreactive with clays in the mud. As a side benefit, SAPP also lowers mud pH. Sequestering is not the same as precipitation because sequestering does not form a solid.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sequestering_agent
salt,"[NaCl] A soft, soluble evaporite mineral also known as halite or rock salt. Because salt is less dense than many sedimentary rocks, it is relatively buoyant and can form salt domes, pillars or curtains by flowing and breaking through or piercing overlying sediments, as seen in the Gulf of Mexico and the Zagros fold belt. Halite can be critical in forming hydrocarbon traps and seals because it tends to flow rather than fracture during deformation, thus preventing hydrocarbons from leaking out of a trap even during and after some types of deformation.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/salt
sacrificial anode,"A protective device to prevent electrolytic corrosion. Anodes (often made of Mg or Al metal) are sacrificed intentionally to protect a steel system, such as a buried pipeline or offshore platform.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sacrificial_anode
sodium acid pyrophosphate,A sequestering agent used to treat cement contamination and a deflocculant for low-temperature water muds. The term is sometimes abbreviated to SAPP.,Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sodium_acid_pyrophosphate
seawater mud,"A water-base mud designed for offshore drilling whose make-up water is taken from the ocean. Sea water contains relatively low salinity, about 3 to 4 wt. % NaCl, but has a high hardness because of Mg+2 and Ca+2 ions. Hardness is removed from sea water by adding NaOH, which precipitates Mg+2 as Mg(OH)2, and by adding Na2CO3, which removes Ca+2 as CaCO3. Mud additives are the same as those used in freshwater mud-bentonite clay, lignosulfonate, lignite, carboxymethylcellulose or polyanionic cellulose and caustic soda. XC polymer may also be used in place of bentonite. Higher concentrations of each additive are required because of salinity effects. Bentonite (if used) should be prehydrated in fresh water.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seawater_mud
sodium phosphate,"A group of salts formed by neutralization of phosphorous or phosphoric acid with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Orthophosphates are phosphoric acid (H3PO4) salts, where 1, 2 or 3 of the hydrogen ions are neutralized. Neutralization with NaOH gives three sodium orthophosphates: (a) monosodium phosphate (MSP), (b) disodium phosphate (DSP) or (c) trisodium phosphate (TSP). Their solutions are buffers in the 4.6 to 12 pH range. TSP is an excellent degreaser. All will precipitate hardness ions such as calcium. Polyphosphates are polymers made from various orthophosphates by dehydration with heat. Sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) is a clay deflocculant and treatment for cement contamination. For clay deflocculation, polyphosphates are limited by the temperature at which they hydrolyze back to orthophosphates, although several that performed up to 280°F [138°C] have been documented in the literature (see reference).

sodium polyacrylate,"Made by neutralizing a linear, anionic polymer made from the monomer acrylic acid, CH2=CHCOO- H+, with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Sodium polyacrylate is often abbreviated to SPA. Polyacrylates are best utilized in soft water with low salinity to achieve the best dispersion and full chain elongation. Even low concentrations of hardness ions, for example, Ca+2, precipitate polyacrylates. Low molecular-weight polyacrylates are used as clay deflocculants. High molecular weight polymers are used for fluid-loss control and as a clay extender. As an extender, SPA is added to bentonite at the grinding plant. It is also used at the rig& in low-solids mud. Divalent cations can negate its benefits as a clay extender. SPA is highly efficient when used to flocculate colloids in native-solids muds, clear-water muds and wastewater cleanup.

soda ash,"Another term for sodium carbonate, a chemical with the formula Na2CO3. It is called soda ash at the drilling rig and is used to treat most types of calcium ion contamination in freshwater and seawater muds. For cement contamination, sodium bicarbonate is used. Calcium ions from drilling gypsum or anhydrite, CaSO4, cause clay flocculation and polymer precipitation and lower pH.

sodium silicate,"Formed by dissolving silica or silicate minerals in NaOH solutions. The silicate anion, SiO4-4, is found in solutions of sodium silicate. Silicate anions form polysilicates, or colloidal silica gel. A silicate mud is a type of shale-inhibitive water base drilling fluid that contains sodium silicate or potassium silicate polymeric ions. These ions adsorb on the shale surface and form a semipermeable osmotic membrane that prevents the transport of water and ions internal to the shale structure. This physicochemical barrier helps improve wellbore stability and provides in-gauge holes through troublesome shale sections that otherwise might require a nonaqueous drilling fluid. Silicate-gel drilling muds were first used in the 1930s to control problematic shales. In the 1990s, silicate nondispersed polymer drilling fluids were reintroduced to provide a high-performance shale-inhibitive water-base fluid, as an alternative to oil-base fluids. The highly inhibitive silicate fluid not only provides wellbore stability but also improves solids control performance with minimal environmental impact.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sodium_silicate
static filtration,"A filtration process in which the slurry being filtered remains static. Filter cake continues to grow thicker as filtration continues. Under static conditions, no cake erosion occurs.

spotting fluid,"A small volume or pill of fluid placed in a wellbore annulus to free differentially stuck pipe. Oil-base mud is the traditional stuck-pipe spotting fluid. Speed in mixing and placing the spot is of primary importance to successfully freeing pipe. Because of concern about mud disposal, spots used offshore are either synthetic-based emulsions or benign water-base formulations. Each type is supplied as prepackaged concentrate designed for rapid access and mixing at the rig. A spot frees pipe by covering the stuck region. It presumably breaks up the filter cake, allowing the spot to migrate into cracks in the cake and between the pipe and the cake, reducing the stuck area and allowing pipe to be pulled free.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spotting_fluid

starch,"A drilling-mud additive used to control fluid loss in water muds ranging from freshwater to saturated-salt to high-pH lime muds. Starches have thermal stability to about 250°F [121°C]. They are subject to bacterial attack unless protected by high salinity or bactericide. Drilling-grade natural starch has API/ISO specifications for quality. Starches are carbohydrates of a general formula (C6H10O5)n and are derived from corn, wheat, oats, rice, potatoes, yucca and similar plants and vegetables. They consist of about 27% linear polymer (amylose) and about 73% branched polymer (amylopectin). The two polymers are intertwined within starch granules. Granules are insoluble in cold water, but soaking in hot water or under steam pressure ruptures their covering and the polymers hydrate into a colloidal suspension. This product is a pregelatinized starch and has been used in muds for many years. Amylose and amylopectin are nonionic polymers that do not interact with electrolytes. Derivatized starches, such as hydroxypropyl and carboxymethyl starches, are used in drill-in fluids, completion fluids and various brine systems as well as in drilling-mud systems. The use of starch typically causes a minimal increase in viscosity while effectively controlling fluid loss.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/starch
static aging test,"A mud test in which the mud sample is not agitated. This test is usually performed at a selected high temperature. Typically, the mud sample is sealed in a mud-aging cell and placed in an oven for a given period of time (often 16 hours, overnight). The cooled mud is tested before it is stirred. Commonly, the sample is retested after it has been stirred. Static-aged mud, before it is stirred, simulates a mud that is static in a well while pipe is out of the hole during a bit trip or logging run. The stirred mud simulates the same mud after arriving at the surface and after being agitated by mud guns and through centrifugal pumps. The amount and kind of mud treatment are determined from these tests.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/static_aging_test
spurt loss,"The instantaneous volume (spurt) of liquid that passes through a filter medium prior to deposition of a competent and controlling filter cake. In static filtration, the spurt volume can be a disproportionately large percentage of the total 30-minute filtrate in an API-type test. This indicates that filter cake is slow in being deposited compared to a similar mud with lower spurt loss. To avoid uncertainties of spurt-loss volume, relative filtrate volume is used in static tests.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spurt_loss
spot,"To place a small volume or pill of fluid in a wellbore annulus to free differentially stuck pipe. Oil-base mud is the traditional stuck-pipe spotting fluid. Speed in mixing and placing the spot is of primary importance to successfully freeing pipe. Because of concern about mud disposal, spots used offshore are either synthetic-based emulsions or benign water-base formulations. Each type is supplied as prepackaged concentrate designed for rapid access and mixing at the rig. A spot frees pipe by covering the stuck region. It presumably breaks up the filter cake, allowing the spot to migrate into cracks in the cake and between the pipe and the cake, reducing the stuck area and allowing pipe to be pulled free.",Verb,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spot
squeeze cementing,"The process of forcing a cement slurry through holes or splits in the casing or liner. Once the slurry encounters a permeable formation, the cement solids are filtered out of the slurry as the liquid phase is forced into the formation matrix in the form of cement filtrate. A properly designed squeeze-cement operation will fill the relevant holes and voids with cement filter cake that will cure to form an impenetrable barrier.",Noun,Well Workover and Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/squeeze_cementing
spud mud,"Mud used to drill a well from surface to a shallow depth. Guar gum or salt gel are commonly used offshore as spud mud. Onshore spud mud is usually a water-base mud containing bentonite clay that is flocculated with lime. In a large-diameter surface hole, a flocculated clay-based mud can remove large gravel cuttings encountered at shallow depths and is simple and inexpensive.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spud_mud
stability meter,"A piece of equipment required to conduct the electrical stability (ES) test, a test for oil-base and synthetic-base muds that indicates the emulsion and oil-wetting qualities of the sample. The test is performed by inserting the ES probe into a cup of 120°F [48.9°C] mud and pushing a test button. The ES meter automatically applies an increasing voltage (from 0 to 2000 volts) across an electrode gap in the probe. Maximum voltage that the mud will sustain across the gap before conducting current is displayed as the ES voltage. The modern ES meter has sine-wave circuitry, whereas older meters used square-wave circuits. (The older units should not be used because they do not correctly address the theory described in the reference below.) The ES sine-wave design and meaning of ES readings have been studied and were found to relate to an oil mud's oil-wetting of solids and to stability of the emulsion droplets in a complex fashion not yet understood.

SSMA,"A copolymer of polystyrene (containing sulfonate groups on the ring) and anhydrous maleic acid (a di-hydroxy acid). The sulfonated ring-structure polymer component is anionic and usually low to moderate in chain length and molecular weight. As such, with negative groups on the structure (amount of negativity depending on degree of sulfonation), it is used as a clay deflocculant for bentonite-based water mud. It is especially stable to temperature up to around 400°F [204°C], and often used in high-density muds to stabilize rheology. Lignosulfonate is used for this purpose up to about 300°F [149°C] and then SSMA polymeric deflocculant is often phased into the mud system for drilling deeper and hotter zones.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/ssma
SRB,"A common anaerobic bacterium, commonly abbreviated SRB, that can convert sulfate ions, SO4-2, into S-2 and HS-, with the concomitant oxidation of a carbon source. The lignite, lignin, tannins, cellulose, starches and fatty acids found in many mud systems are carbon food sources for SRB. Where mud is stored, precautions should always be taken when handling or reconditioning water muds containing lignosulfonates, gypsum (sulfate sources) and starches, cellulose, xanthan gum and lignite (food sources). These muds can harbor SRB and can have high sulfide accumulations. Mud filtrate should be tested with the Garrett Gas Train to determine sulfide concentration in a stored mud, followed by treatments with caustic soda to raise pH and zinc-based scavengers to remove sulfides as ZnS. Before storage of mud, treatment with a bactericide can inhibit SRB growth. Also, circulating mud from time to time, with air entrainment, can retard development of anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic bacteria can convert the sulfate or sulfite present in water handling facilities to hydrogen sulfide [H2S]. This by-product, combined with iron, can form iron sulfide, a scale that is very difficult to remove. SRB occur naturally in surface waters, including seawater. Bacteria accumulation can lead to pitting of steel, and the buildup of H2S increases the corrosiveness of the water, thus increasing the possibility of hydrogen blistering or sulfide stress cracking.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/srb

trip pill,"Also called a slug, a volume of mud that is more dense than the mud in the drillpipe and wellbore annulus. A slug is used to displace mud out of the upper part of the drillpipe before pulling pipe out of the hole and is mixed in the pill pit by adding additional weighting material (barite) to a few barrels of mud from the surface pits. The pill is pumped into the top of the drillstring to push mud downward, out of the pipe, thus keeping the upper stands of pipe empty.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/trip_pill
turbulent flow,"A fluid-flow regime characterized by swirling or chaotic motion as the fluid moves along the pipe or conduit. The linear velocity of the fluid particles is similar regardless of position in the conduit, although particles close to the conduit walls have a lower velocity.

Retort solids thus include suspended solids, dissolved solids (salts), charred organic materials and volatile materials that do not condense. For calculations, retort solids are normally assumed to be only suspended and dissolved solids.

Volume percent suspended solids (weighting material plus drill solids) is of particular interest to mud engineers. To calculate that percentage, the volume increase caused by the dissolved salts is determined from filtrate analyses of chloride and calcium ions. For oil muds, the calculations are more complicated.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/total_solids

thixotropy,"The characteristic of a fluid, such as a drilling mud, to form a gelled structure over time when not subject to shearing and then to liquefy when agitated. The viscosity of a thixotropic fluid changes with time under constant shear rate until reaching equilibrium. Most drilling muds exhibit thixotropy, which is necessary for fast drilling, efficient cuttings lifting and to support weighting material when mud flow stops.

Marsh funnel,"A conical-shaped funnel, fitted with a small-bore tube on the bottom end through which mud flows under a gravity head. A screen over the top removes large particles that might plug the tube. In the test standardized by API for evaluating water-base and oil-base muds, the funnel viscosity measurement is the time (in seconds) required for one quart of mud to flow out of a Marsh funnel into a graduated mud cup. Funnel viscosity is reported in seconds (for a quart). Water exits the funnel in about 26 seconds. This test was one of the earliest mud measurements for field use. Simple, quick and fool-proof, it still serves as a useful indicator of change in the mud by comparing mud-in and mud-out sample funnel viscosities.

Hallan N. Marsh of Los Angeles published the design and use of his funnel viscometer in 1931, and it is worth the time to read the detailed, often humorous, discussion that followed. Mr. Marsh was a forward thinking mud technologist in his day, as can be seen from the following words from his 1931 AIME paper: ""The subject of mud sounds so simple, uninteresting and unimportant that it has failed to receive the attention that it deserves, at least as applied to the drilling of oil wells.

mudcake,"The residue deposited on a permeable medium when a slurry, such as a drilling fluid, is forced against the medium under a pressure. Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filter-cake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filter cake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filter cake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mudcake
mud tracer,"A type of nonreactive, easily differentiated material placed in a small portion of a circulating mud system at a certain time to be identified when it later returns to the surface from downhole.

The in sample is also called the suction-pit sample, or ""mud in"" on a drilling fluid report. This mud has been treated and properly weighted and is in good condition to encounter downhole pressures, temperatures and contamination. Comparisons are made between properties of this mud-in sample and the ""out"" or mud-out sample taken at surface prior to solids removal.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mud_in
mud pit,"A large tank that holds drilling fluid on the rig or at a mud-mixing plant. For land rigs, most mud pits are rectangular steel construction, with partitions that hold about 200 barrels each. They are set in series for the active mud system. On most offshore rigs, pits are constructed into the drilling vessel and are larger, holding up to 1000 barrels. Circular pits are used at mixing plants and on some drilling rigs to improve mixing efficiency and reduce dead spots that allow settling. Earthen mud pits were the earliest type of mud pit, but environmental protection concern has led to less frequent use of open pits in the ground. Today, earthen pits are used only to store used or waste mud and cuttings prior to disposal and remediation of the site of the pit.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mud_pit

Mud includes all types of water-base, oil-base and synthetic-base drilling fluids. Drill-in, completion and workover fluids are sometimes called muds, although a fluid that is essentially free of solids is not strictly considered mud.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mud
MMH,"A compound containing hydroxide anions in association with two or more metal cations. MMH particles are extremely small and carry multiple positive charges. They can associate with bentonite to form a strong complex that exhibits highly shear-thinning properties, with high and fragile gel strengths, high yield point (YP), and low plastic viscosity (PV). MMH is described as a mixed-metal layered hydroxide (MMLH). In the crystal layers, Al+3 , Mg+2 and OH- ions reside, but due to symmetry considerations, there is not enough room for sufficient OH- ions to electrically offset the charges of the two cations. Therefore, a net positive charge exists on the crystal surfaces. Exchangeable anions sit on the positive surface (much the same as cations sit on negative clay surfaces). MMH muds are used as nondamaging drilling fluids, metal-reaming fluids (to carry out metal cuttings) and for wellbore shale control. Being cationic, MMH mud is sensitive to anionic deflocculants and small anionic polymers, such as polyphosphates, lignosulfonate or lignite.

encapsulation,"In drilling fluid parlance, the absorption of a polymer film onto cuttings and wellbore walls to form a coat or barrier. The term is usually applied to shale encapsulation by long-chain, acrylamide-acrylate (PHPA) polymers. Negative sites on PHPA may bond to positive sites on the clays in shales, although it is not well-defined how (or how well) encapsulation works. A viscous polymer film, according to some test results, slows diffusion of water molecules into the shale and thus slows hydration and disintegration. This does not prevent wellbore problems but can delay their onset.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/encapsulation
