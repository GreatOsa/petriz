eddy current measurement,"A technique for measuring the effect of pits and holes in the inner wall of a casing on a high-frequency electrical signal induced in the casing. The eddy-current measurement is used in conjunction with a flux-leakage measurement to determine casing corrosion, the latter being sensitive to the defects on both the inner and outer walls. The principle of measurement is similar to the openhole induction log, but at higher frequencies. A transmitter coil produces a magnetic field that induces eddy currents in the casing wall. These currents generate their own magnetic field that induces a signal in two closely spaced receiver coils. In smooth casing, these signals are the same, but if the inner wall is pitted, the signals are different. Transmitter-receiver combinations are placed on multiple pads applied against the casing at several azimuths to fully cover the casing wall.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/eddy_current_measurement
electric probe,"A small sensor in a production logging tool that distinguishes between hydrocarbon and water in its vicinity as it is moved up and down a production well. The electric probe was the first type of local probe to be introduced, appearing initially in the early 1990s. Electric probes measure the local and average holdup of water and give an image of the flow structure across the well. Most electric probes emit a high-frequency current and measure the amplitude of the signal, and hence the impedance, of the fluid in a small sphere near the probe. The output is designed to be digital, indicating conductance when the probe is in front of water, and no conductance when it is in front of hydrocarbon. The water must have a certain minimum salinity, below which the device will not work.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electric_probe
emulsion flow,"A multiphase-flow regime with oil as the continuous phase, in which water exists as small, approximately homogeneously distributed droplets. There may also be a thin film of water on the pipe wall.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/emulsion_flow
electromagnetic caliper,"An in-situ measurement of the inside diameter of a casing or tubing using an electromagnetic technique. As with the electromagnetic thickness measurement, and usually measured at the same time, a coil centered inside the casing generates an alternating magnetic field. Another coil farther up the tool measures the phase shift introduced by the casing. At high frequency, the signal penetrates less than a tenth of a millimeter into the casing, and the phase shift can be related to the casing internal diameter. Unlike a mechanical or ultrasonic caliper, the measurement does not respond to nonmagnetic scale. For the purpose of determining the true internal diameter, this is a disadvantage, but for the purpose of determining corrosion, it is an advantage.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electromagnetic_caliper
electrical impedance probe,"Another term for electric probe, a small sensor in a production logging tool that distinguishes between hydrocarbon and water in its vicinity as it is moved up and down a production well.

flow-concentrating,Referring to a type of spinner flowmeter in which most or all of the fluid flow in the well is diverted over the spinner by a device such as a basket or a packer.,Adjective,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow-concentrating
flowing neutron log,A neutron porosity log recorded while the well is flowing to determine the gas-oil contact in the borehole. The log is often compared with a log run while the well is shut-in. The term was used in the1950s and 1960s but is now obsolete.,Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flowing_neutron_log
friction effect,"In a gradiomanometer tool or pressure derivative calculation, the apparent increased fluid density observed due to frictional pressure losses along the tool and casing in a fast-flowing fluid. The magnitude of the correction depends on the flow rate, tool geometry and the casing size, and is negligible in most casings below about 2000 B/D [318 m3/d]. The fluid density will appear erroneously high unless this effect is corrected for.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/friction_effect
froth flow,"A multiphase flow regime in near-vertical pipes in which large, irregular slugs of gas move up the center of the pipe, usually carrying droplets of oil or water with them. Most of the remaining oil or water flows up along the pipe walls. The flow is relatively chaotic, producing a frothy mixture. Unlike slug flow, neither phase is continuous. The gas slugs are relatively unstable, and take on large, elongated shapes. Also known as transition flow, this flow is an intermediate flow condition between slug flow and mist flow, and occurs at relatively high gas velocity. As the gas velocity increases, it changes into annular flow.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/froth_flow
FPSO,"Abbreviation for floating production, storage, and offloading vessel. FPSOs are commonly deployed for offshore production in locations that have little infrastructure. They serve as gathering, processing and storage facilities for fluids produced from subsea wells. Processed using equipment on the ship’s deck, the fluids are then stored in the ship’s hull before they are offloaded to pipelines, barges, or ships. Produced natural gas may be sent to shore via pipeline or flared if no pipeline is readily available.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fpso
fullbore spinner,"A type of flowmeter in which the spinner blades are collapsed to pass through the tubing and other restrictions, and then opened up below to sense the full cross section of the casing or openhole. In this way, a much larger fraction of the flow is measured. Introduced in the 1970s, the fullbore spinner gives a better average flow velocity than a conventional flowmeter, particularly at low flow rates and with simple biphasic-flow regimes. However, when the flow structure is complex, such as with multiphase flow in highly deviated wells, the average flow velocity may not be meaningful.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fullbore_spinner
flowmeter,A device installed in a pump manifold or treating line to measure the fluid flow rate. Flowmeters can be used to measure the flow rates of liquid or gas and are available in various configurations and with differing operating principles.,Noun,Well Workover and Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flowmeter
flow loop,"A laboratory instrument for investigating the characteristics of fluid flow in pipes and for studying the response of production logging instruments to this flow. The fluids are circulated continuously in a loop, passing through one main measurement section that can be placed at different deviations from vertical through horizontal. Fluid properties, holdups and velocities can all be varied. Flow loops are essential for the study of multiphase flow and the development of new production logging measurements.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_loop
fluid-density log,"A record of the density, or changes in density, of fluids in a production or injection well. Since gas, oil and water all have different densities, the log can determine the percentage, or holdup, of the different fluids, directly in the case of biphasic flow, and in combination with other measurements for triphasic flow. Fluid density is measured by a gradiomanometer or a nuclear fluid densimeter, and can also be derived from the depth derivative of a pressure sensor.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fluid-density_log
flow meter,A device installed in a pump manifold or treating line to measure the fluid flow rate. Flowmeters can be used to measure the flow rates of liquid or gas and are available in various configurations and with differing operating principles.,Noun,Well Workover and Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_meter
fluid-interface log,"An in-situ measurement of the flow profile made by pumping different fluids down the tubing and casing and observing the interface between them. The fluids are normally both water, but one may be fresh and the other salty, or else one may contain some tracer, so that the interface can be detected by a production-logging tool. After the tubing is run to the bottom of the well, an interface is introduced by one of two methods. In the static method, the total flow rate is held constant and the relative flow rate of the two streams is changed. The location of the interface after each change is used to determine the flow profile. In the dynamic method, one fluid is pumped at different rates. The log was used in the 1950s and 1960s but is now used rarely, having been replaced by fluid-density logs and others.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fluid-interface_log
flow profile,"A recording of the in-situ rate of fluid flow at different depths in a well, normally one completed for production or injection. The flow profile is a log recorded in a unit such as barrels per day, or as a percentage of the total flow from the reservoir in a production well or into the reservoir in an injection well. In single-phase flow, the profile can be determined from a flowmeter. In multiphase flow, it is desirable to show the flow rates of each of the phases, in which case a holdup log and either a flowmeter or a phase velocity log are needed.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_profile

flow structure,"A description of the geometrical distribution of a fluid moving through a pipe. The term is similar to the term flow regime, but is used to describe larger scale features in which there may be more than one flow regime. For example, in a deviated well there may be bubble flow of gas in oil in the uppermost part of the pipe, and water only in the lowest part.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_structure
flow concentrating,Referring to a type of spinner flowmeter in which most or all of the fluid flow in the well is diverted over the spinner by a device such as a basket or a packer.,Adjective,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_concentrating
flow regime,"The predominant flow geometry reflected in a pressure-transient response that is most easily recognized in the log-log presentation of the pressure-change derivative. The most easily recognized flow regime is radial flow, which produces a constant or flat derivative. Spherical flow, which may result from a limited-entry completion, has a characteristic -1/2 slope in the derivative. Wellbore storage starts as a unit slope in pressure change and then the derivative bends over in a characteristic hump shape. Linear flow produced by flow to a fracture or a long horizontal well has a derivative slope of +1/2. Bilinear flow results when the fracture has finite conductivity and has a derivative slope of +1/4.",Noun,Well Testing,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_regime
flux leakage,"A distortion of the magnetic flux that has been introduced into a casing by a low-frequency electromagnet or permanent magnet. The principle of flux leakage is used to detect casing corrosion, since flux leakage is caused by rapid changes in the thickness of the casing and by pits and holes in either the internal or external wall. Flux leakage distorts the magnetic-flux lines and induces a signal into an electric coil moving past it. In-situ flux-leakage measurements make use of this effect by placing coils on or close to the casing wall, azimuthally distributed to cover the entire wall. The results are often combined with a high-frequency, eddy-current measurement, designed to detect flaws only on the inner wall.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flux_leakage
gas-holdup log,"A record of the fraction of gas present at different depths in the borehole. Although several techniques may be used for this purpose, the term usually refers to logs based on one of two principles. In the first, four or more optical probes are used to detect the passage of gas bubbles at different points across the borehole. As with other local probes, holdup is determined by the fraction of time the probe detects gas. In the second technique, a 57Co (cobalt) source emits low-energy gamma rays that undergo backscattering and photoelectric absorption in the borehole fluid before being counted in a detector. The number of counts is related to the fluid density, and can be calibrated in terms of gas holdup. The first technique produces an image of gas holdup along and around the borehole, while the second technique produces a log of the average holdup along the well.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gas-holdup_log

gradiomanometer,"A device for measuring the average density of the fluid at different depths in a completed production or injection well to produce a fluid-density log. Knowing the density of the individual phases allows their holdups to be determined, directly in the case of biphasic flow, and in combination with other measurements for triphasic flow. Introduced in the late 1950s, the gradiomanometer measures the pressure difference between two pressure sensors, placed approximately 2 ft [0.6 m] apart. The pressure difference reflects the average fluid density across the well within that depth interval. The resolution is high, around 0.005 g/cm3, but the accuracy can be affected by a friction effect, a kinetic effect and well deviation. The effect of deviation can be corrected, but the sensitivity to holdup is reduced as the deviation increases until it is zero in a horizontal well. Note: Gradiomanometer is a mark of Schlumberger. It is now a commonly accepted term for a certain tool that measures differential pressure.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gradiomanometer
gamma ray densitometer,"A device for measuring the density of fluids in a completed well, using a radioactive source of gamma rays and a detector. In most instruments, a 137Cs (cesium) or 241Am (americium) source is used to induce Compton scattering, as in the openhole density measurement, except that the device is unfocused. The count rate at the detector then depends primarily on the density of the fluids in the well. In some devices, the fluids pass through an open space in the body of the tool within which the measurement is made. The results then reflect the density of the fluids passing through the tool. In other devices, the source and detector are isolated so that the gamma rays pass outside the tool. The results then reflect some average density of all the fluids within the well. In smaller casings, some formation signal may contaminate the measurement. Compared with a gradiomanometer, the nuclear fluid densimeter is a less direct measurement of density, and has a statistical uncertainty and less resolution. On the other hand, it is not affected by well deviation, friction or kinetic effects.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gamma_ray_densitometer
gravel-pack log,"A record of the quality of a gravel pack and the quantity of solid particles it contains. The traditional logging technique uses a type of nuclear fluid densimeter, with a gamma ray source and a single detector. The number of gamma rays reaching the detector is inversely proportional to the gravel-pack density. The count rate is used qualitatively, being scaled in each well between zones with 100% pack and zero pack, or else compared before and after a repair to the pack. The density measurement is not entirely independent of the formation, and is not effective when the density of the particles and the completion fluid are similar. In these cases, a neutron activation or neutron-porosity measurement may be used. Other techniques include a neutron porosity log and tracer measurements. Radioactive tracers may be coated on the outside of the particles or else included within the particles. They can be detected by gamma ray logs, or if a variety of tracers is used they can be tracked with a multiple-isotope log.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gravel-pack_log
holdup image,"A two-dimensional display, using colors or different grey scales, of the holdup around the borehole versus depth. The x-axis of the image shows different segments of the borehole, normally inside a casing, displayed from the top of the hole clockwise around through the bottom and back to the top again. Depth is in the z-axis, while the values of holdup are represented by different colors or changes from black to white. The holdup image is constructed from between four and eight local probe measurements using interpolation within constraints. Images, sometimes called maps, are also made for bubble count and bubble velocity.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/holdup_image
holdup meter,"A device for determining the water holdup in a producing well by measuring the capacitance or impedance of the fluid. The holdup meter is used to produce a capacitance log. Since water has a high dielectric constant, and hence capacitance, it can be distinguished from oil or gas. The meter is a coaxial capacitor, with fluid flowing between a central probe and an external cage that act as electrodes. The meter has often been combined with a packer flowmeter or a diverter flowmeter, so that all the fluids in the well pass through the meter.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/holdup_meter
holdup log,"A record of the fractions of different fluids present at different depths in the borehole. Various techniques are used to measure these fractions. The earliest techniques measured the fluid density, using a gradiomanometer or a nuclear fluid densimeter, or the dielectric properties, as in the capacitance or water-cut meter. While these techniques were satisfactory in near-vertical wells with two-phase flow, they were often found to be inadequate in highly deviated and horizontal wells, where flow structures are complex. More recent developments are based on the use of multiple local probes to detect bubbles of gas, oil or water, and on a combination of nuclear techniques usually known as three-phase holdup.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/holdup_log
holdup map,"A two-dimensional display, using colors or different grey scales, of the holdup around the borehole versus depth. The x-axis of the image shows different segments of the borehole, normally inside a casing, displayed from the top of the hole clockwise around through the bottom and back to the top again. Depth is in the z-axis, while the values of holdup are represented by different colors or changes from black to white. The holdup image is constructed from between four and eight local probe measurements using interpolation within constraints. Images, sometimes called maps, are also made for bubble count and bubble velocity.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/holdup_map
holdup,"With reference to multiphase flow in pipes, the fraction of a particular fluid present in an interval of pipe. In multiphase flow, each fluid moves at a different speed due to different gravitational forces and other factors, with the heavier phase moving slower, or being more held up, than the lighter phase. The holdup of a particular fluid is not the same as the proportion of the total flow rate due to that fluid, also known as its cut. To determine in-situ flow rates, it is necessary to measure the holdup and velocity of each fluid. Holdup is usually given the symbol y, with the suffixes g, o or w for gas, oil or water. The sum of the holdups of the fluids present is unity. The holdup ratio is the ratio of the holdups of two fluids, and is sometimes used as a parameter to express the phenomenon.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/holdup
bead tracer,"A small, radioactive plastic sphere that is insoluble and used to make a tracer-loss measurement. The bead is designed to have the same density as the injection fluid so that it travels with the fluid when it is placed in the flow stream of an injection well. However, the bead does not enter the formation. It remains on the rock face in openhole, or within the perforation channel in cased hole, where it can be detected by a gamma ray log. A high radioactivity opposite a perforation indicates a large number of beads and hence a high injectivity. The technique was used mainly in the 1960s and 1970s.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bead_tracer
biphasic,"Referring to the flow of two immiscible fluids, oil and water, oil and gas, or gas and water.",Adjective,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/biphasic
basket flowmeter,"A device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well in which the flow is diverted through the spinner by a set of metal vanes, or petals. The vanes are closed while running in the hole, and then opened with the tool stationary at the measurement depth. The petals do not seal completely against each other or against the side of the hole, so that not all the fluid is diverted. A type of diverter flowmeter, the petal basket design has generally been replaced since the late 1980s by the inflatable diverter and other designs.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/basket_flowmeter
bubble count,"The frequency with which a local probe detects a change from one type of fluid to another. For example, if water is the continuous phase, the probe will respond digitally each time a bubble of oil or gas passes it. The average frequency of change is the bubble count rate, or bubble count. In this example, an increasing bubble count means an increasing oil or gas velocity. Bubble velocity can be calculated from bubble count and bubble size, the latter being estimated from an empirical correlation with water holdup. The depth at which the first bubbles are counted is a sensitive indicator of the lowest hydrocarbon entry. Since the bubble count is based on local probe measurements, both bubble count and bubble velocity can be presented as images, similar to the holdup image.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bubble_count
bypass velocity,"In a spinner flowmeter, the theoretical minimum fluid velocity required to initiate spinner rotation, assuming the spinner response is linear. In this sense, it is synonymous with threshold velocity. However, it is sometimes taken to mean the fluid velocity at which a significant amount of flow begins to leak past a basket flowmeter, sufficient to cause the response to be nonlinear.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bypass_velocity
bubble flow,"A multiphase fluid flow regime characterized by the gas phase being distributed as bubbles through the liquid phase. In a producing wellbore where the bubbles are uniformly distributed, there is little relative motion between the phases. Where the bubbles congregate and combine to form a less uniform distribution of the gas phase, some slippage will occur between the phases with the gas tending to cut through the liquid phase.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bubble_flow
casing-inspection log,"An in situ record of casing thickness and integrity, to determine whether and to what extent the casing has undergone corrosion. The term refers to an individual measurement, or a combination of measurements using acoustic, electrical, and mechanical techniques, to evaluate the casing thickness and other parameters. The log is usually presented with the basic measurements and an estimate of metal loss. It was first introduced in the early 1960s. Today, the terms casing-evaluation log and pipe-inspection log are used synonymously.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/casing-inspection_log
casing-potential profile,"An in situ log of the electrical potential on the inner wall of a casing. The log is used to identify intervals that are susceptible to corrosion. A negative slope in the profile indicates a zone in which current is leaving the casing and therefore acting as an anode. Such zones are susceptible to corrosion. The log was first introduced in the early 1960s. Modern logs are recorded with the tool stationary, and measure the potential difference and casing resistance between several pairs of sensors pushed against the casing wall, and between sensors and surface. The log is usually represented with casing resistance and casing axial current. Sharp increases in casing resistance can indicate corroded zones or even holes in the casing. Decreasing axial current with depth indicates a corroding region.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/casing-potential_profile
capacitance meter,"Another term for holdup meter, a device for determining the water holdup in a producing well by measuring the capacitance or impedance of the fluid. The holdup meter is used to produce a capacitance log. Since water has a high dielectric constant, and hence capacitance, it can be distinguished from oil or gas. The meter is a coaxial capacitor, with fluid flowing between a central probe and an external cage that act as electrodes. The meter has often been combined with a packer flowmeter or a diverter flowmeter, so that all the fluids in the well pass through the meter.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/capacitance_meter
correlate,"To seek a comparison or equivalence. Scientists attempt to compare or match up well log signatures, chemical signatures, seismic signatures, fossils and rock samples across wide areas to determine the equivalence, extent, thickness, quality, relative age or other properties of stratigraphic units and rock bodies.",vt.,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/correlate
capacitance log,"An in situ record of the capability of the fluid passing through a sensor to store electrical charge. Since water has a high dielectric constant, and hence capacitance, it can be distinguished from oil or gas. The capacitance, or fluid capacitance log, can therefore identify water and be scaled in terms of water holdup. However, the relation between capacitance and holdup depends strongly on whether the water is the continuous phase, complicating quantitative evaluation.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/capacitance_log
casing inspection log,"An in situ record of casing thickness and integrity, to determine whether and to what extent the casing has undergone corrosion.

Decreasing axial current with depth indicates a corroding region.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/casing_potential_profile
controlled time survey,"A method of determining injection-flow profiles by monitoring the reduction in tracer material as it moves down the well. A slug of radioactive tracer is added to the injection fluid. As the slug moves down the well, several gamma ray logs are recorded at well-defined time intervals. The position of the slug is seen as a large gamma ray peak whose size is proportional to the flow rate. A reduction in the size of the peak indicates a loss of fluid into the formation. Fluid velocity can be calculated from the time interval and the distance the peak has moved using timed-slug analysis. Tracer-loss measurements produce a type of radioactive-tracer log, used mainly to give a general idea of fluid flow in low flow-rate wells. In very low flow-rate wells, an alternative technique has been used in which the gamma ray detector is held stationary at some depth until the slug has passed. The detector is then moved down to another depth to observe the slug again. With these data, it is possible to make quantitative estimates of fluid flow.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/controlled_time_survey
chemical marker injection,"A technique in which a slug of material is introduced into the flowstream of a producing well to determine the flow rate of one or more of the fluids. The marker has specific properties, such as high neutron capture cross section, that allow it to be detected by sensors of a production logging tool. Some markers are specifically designed to be soluble in only one fluid phase, so that they can be used to produce a phase-velocity log. The term refers to nonradioactive markers, in contrast to the more traditional radioactive markers, or tracers.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/chemical_marker_injection

churn flow,"A multiphase flow regime in near-vertical pipes in which large, irregular slugs of gas move up the center of the pipe, usually carrying droplets of oil or water with them. Most of the remaining oil or water flows up along the pipe walls. The flow is relatively chaotic, producing a frothy mixture. Unlike slug flow, neither phase is continuous. The gas slugs are relatively unstable, and take on large, elongated shapes. Also known as transition flow, this flow is an intermediate flow condition between slug flow and mist flow and occurs at relatively high gas velocity. As the gas velocity increases, it changes into annular flow.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/churn_flow
cut,"The fraction of the total flow rate produced from a well that is due to a particular fluid, for example the water cut in the case of water. The cut is normally quoted at standard surface conditions.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cut
crosscorrelation flowmeter,"A device for measuring fluid velocity in a production well. The device measures the transit time of a disturbance between two sensors separated by a fixed distance. The technology applies to multiphase flow, in which the disturbance is caused, for example, by the passage of a bubble of gas over each sensor. In practice, there will be many bubbles of gas, so it is necessary to record both sensor signals over a time window and compare, or correlate, them. The two signals will correlate best after shifting one of them by a time corresponding to the average transit time of the bubbles. Different sensors may be used, for example a measure of electrical capacitance as in a holdup meter. The crosscorrelation flowmeter gives the velocity of the disturbance. Since this is caused by just one of the phases, it produces a type of phase velocity log.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/crosscorrelation_flowmeter
differential-temperature log,A record of the difference in temperature between two vertical points in a well. Most differential-temperature logs are obtained by differentiating a normal temperature log with respect to depth. Some are obtained by recording the difference in temperature between two vertically displaced sensors. Note that the differential-temperature log and the radial differential-temperature log are not the same.,Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/differential-temperature_log
deflector flowmeter,"A device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well in which the total fluid flow is diverted to pass over an impeller, or spinner. Various techniques have been used to achieve this, one of the earliest being the packer flowmeter. In a typical modern device, the diverter consists of a fabric in a metal cage that is collapsed to pass through the tubing and other restrictions. Below the tubing, the cage is opened until an inflatable ring seals against the casing wall. At this point, the up-going production fluids are forced through the diverter and over an impeller. This ensures that the total casing flow is measured, but may also create an extra pressure drop and hence a change in multiphase flow structure. The diverter flowmeter is particularly suitable for low flow rates in vertical or moderately deviated wells. Readings are made with the tool stationary.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/deflector_flowmeter
differential temperature log,A record of the difference in temperature between two vertical points in a well. Most differential-temperature logs are obtained by differentiating a normal temperature log with respect to depth. Some are obtained by recording the difference in temperature between two vertically displaced sensors. Note that the differential-temperature log and the radial differential-temperature log are not the same.,Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/differential_temperature_log
depth correlation,The process of comparing and fixing measured depths with known features on baseline logs of the wellbore tubulars and the surrounding formation.,Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depth_correlation
dispersed bubble flow,"A multiphase flow regime in pipes in which one fluid moves as small dispersed bubbles through a continuous fluid. The relative velocity of the bubbles depends mainly on the difference in density between the two fluids. Bubble flow normally occurs at low flow rate and low holdup of the bubbly fluid. As the velocity of the continuous fluid increases, the bubbles are dispersed into smaller, more widely separated bubbles. This is known as a dispersed or finely dispersed bubble flow, or sometimes dispersed flow.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dispersed_bubble_flow
drag bag,Pertaining to a technique in which a packer flowmeter is partially inflated and dragged up the hole to give a continuous flow log. This obsolete technique was introduced in the 1960s because the packer flowmeter could make only stationary measurements.,Adjective,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/drag_bag
distributed temperature log,"A record of the change in temperature along a well, normally recorded by a fiber-optic cable. The distributed temperature is measured by sending a pulse of laser light down the optical fiber. Molecular vibration, which is directly related to temperature, creates weak reflected signals. These signals are detected at the surface and converted to a log of temperature along the well, sampled approximately every 1 m [3.28 ft] with a resolution of 0.1 degC. The fiber-optic cable is normally installed at the time of well completion, so that the distributed temperature log can be recorded at any later time without well intervention. Introduced in the mid-1990s, the technique can also be used to measure flow rates by creating a temperature transient and observing its movement along the well.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/distributed_temperature_log
diverter flowmeter,"A device for measuring in-situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well in which the total fluid flow is diverted to pass over an impeller, or spinner. Various techniques have been used to achieve this, one of the earliest being the packer flowmeter. In a typical modern device, the diverter consists of a fabric in a metal cage that is collapsed to pass through the tubing and other restrictions. Below the tubing, the cage is opened until an inflatable ring seals against the casing wall. At this point, the up-going production fluids are forced through the diverter and over an impeller. This ensures that the total casing flow is measured, but may also create an extra pressure drop and hence a change in multiphase flow structure. The diverter flowmeter is particularly suitable for low flow rates in vertical or moderately deviated wells. Readings are made with the tool stationary.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diverter_flowmeter
radioactive-tracer log,"A record of the presence of tracer material placed in or around the borehole to measure fluid movement in injection wells. There are two traditional techniques for recording radioactive-tracer logs: the tracer-loss measurement, in which a tracer material is added to the completion fluid and its progress monitored with a gamma ray tool; and the velocity-shot measurement, in which the tracer is ejected from one part of a production logging tool and its progress monitored by one or more gamma ray detectors farther down the tool. Radioactive-tracer logs are used to determine injection-flow profiles and detect channels or leaks. They may also be used in production wells, but care must be taken to isolate the fluids on surface until the tracer has decayed to safe levels. The tracer is a radioactive isotope that is soluble in water, oil or gas, or else insoluble, as in the bead tracer. Different radioactive elements with distinct energies and lifetimes may be used. Today, for water injection, the most common is a water-soluble iodine tracer that has a half-life of 8.1 days, while for steam injection a gas with krypton is used.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/radioactive-tracer_log
radial differential temperature log,"A record of the difference in temperature between the opposite sides of the internal wall of a casing. The log is mainly used to detect a channel in the cement, since the fluid moving in the channel is likely to be cooler or warmer than its surroundings. The two temperature probes are held on arms that are extended to touch the casing wall at depths where a channel is suspected. The assembly is then rotated through 360o to give the radial differential-temperature log. A sinusoid indicates a channel. Temperature differences are small, typically 0.005 to 0.05oF [0.003 to 0.03oC], but can be enhanced by injecting cooler fluids from surface.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/radial_differential_temperature_log
kinetic effect,"In a gradiomanometer tool, the pressure difference observed when the fluid velocity opposite the upper pressure sensor differs from that across the lower pressure sensor. This difference usually occurs opposite points of fluid entry or exit, and at sudden changes in diameter, such as at the tubing shoe. The result is a sharp deflection on the log that may be misinterpreted as a local change in fluid density.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/k/kinetic_effect
laminar flow,"A type of streamlined flow for single-phase fluids in which the fluid moves in parallel layers, or laminae. The layers flow smoothly over each other with instabilities being dampened by the viscosity. Laminar flow occurs in straight pipes when the Reynolds number is below a critical value, corresponding to a low production rate. Above this value, the flow is turbulent. For laminar flow in straight pipes, the velocity profile across the pipe is parabolic, increasing from zero at the wall of the pipe to a maximum at the center equal to twice the mean velocity.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/laminar_flow
local probe,"A small sensor, part of a production logging tool, which determines the type of fluid in its vicinity as it moves up and down a production well. Typically there are four or more sensors, or probes, held on arms to measure the four quadrants of the well cross-section. The probes may be electrical, to distinguish hydrocarbon from water; optical, mainly to distinguish gas from liquid, but also oil from water; or dielectric, mainly to distinguish water from hydrocarbon, but also, with less resolution, oil from gas. They can detect bubbles that are larger than about 1 mm diameter. Their response is essentially digital, indicating either one fluid or the other, so that the percentage of time that they see a fluid is a direct measure of its holdup. The rate of change between the two fluids is known as the bubble count. The results can be averaged to give the mean holdup and bubble count, or converted into an image, showing the holdup or bubble count at different locations across the well at different depths. The image is particularly useful in highly deviated or horizontal wells where different flow regimes may be found in different quadrants.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/local_probe
local holdup,"The fraction of a particular fluid measured in the vicinity of a small probe in a production well. The small, or local, probes respond digitally to the type of fluid in front of them, indicating gas, oil or water depending on the type of probe. The local holdup of oil, for example, is determined by the percentage of time the probe spends in front of oil.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/local_holdup
injection pulsed neutron log,"An in-situ recording in which a material with high neutron-capture cross section is injected into the flowstream of a production or injection well to determine fluid paths and velocities. The material used is normally borax or water with high salinity, both of which cause a significant increase in the capture cross section measured by a pulsed-neutron log. In the most common application, the material is injected across the producing intervals of a production well. By comparing pulsed neutron logs recorded before and after injection, the injectivity, and hence productivity, of each interval can be estimated. Any cement channels or leaks will also be observed.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/injection_pulsed_neutron_log
injection/pulsed neutron log,"An in-situ recording in which a material with high neutron-capture cross section is injected into the flowstream of a production or injection well to determine fluid paths and velocities. The material used is normally borax or water with high salinity, both of which cause a significant increase in the capture cross section measured by a pulsed-neutron log.

Any cement channels or leaks will also be observed.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/injectionpulsed_neutron_log
impeller,"A device that responds to fluid flow and is used as the sensor in a flowmeter. In a spinner flowmeter, the term refers to the spinner, or in some cases to one of the blades of the spinner. An impeller is also used in a torque flowmeter.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/impeller
impulse activation,"A type of oxygen activation technique for measuring water flow in which a short neutron burst is followed by a long observation period, during which the activated flowing oxygen is recognized at the detector by its signature. Stationary oxygen gives a gradually decaying signal, whereas flowing oxygen can be distinguished by a peak at a time after the neutron pulse that is related to its velocity. To cover a wide range in water velocity, several detectors at different spacings are needed. The flow volume can be estimated from the area under the peak. While recordings are typically made with the tool stationary, continuous logs are also possible. In an alternative type of impulse method, the neutrons are emitted in regular bursts until the count rate from the activated oxygen reaches a constant level. Then, after terminating the bursts, the time for the count rate to decrease by one half is measured. This time can be related to the water velocity.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/impulse_activation
interval method,"A technique for improving the accuracy of injection profiles measured using the velocity-shot method. In the normal velocity-shot method, the flow velocity is determined by the time of flight of a radioactive slug between two detectors or between ejector and detector. Since the distance involved may be several feet, the vertical resolution is low. The interval method consists of making overlapping measurements from which a higher resolution injection profile may be determined.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/interval_method
Joule–Thomson,"Referring to the change in temperature observed when a gas expands while flowing through a restriction without any heat entering or leaving the system. The change may be positive or negative. For each gas, there is an inversion point that depends on temperature and pressure, below which it is cooled and above which it is heated. For example, for methane, at 100 degC [212 degF], the inversion point occurs at about 500 atmospheres [7,350 psi]. The magnitude of the change of temperature with pressure depends on the Joule–Thomson coefficient for a particular gas. The Joule–Thomson effect often causes a temperature decrease as gas flows through pores of a reservoir to the wellbore.",Adjective,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/j/joule-thomson
neutron-activation log,"A record of elemental concentrations derived from the characteristic energy levels of gamma rays emitted by a nucleus that has been activated by neutron bombardment. In the context of production logging, the term normally refers to the activation of silicon and aluminum to determine the quality of a gravel pack. Silicon and aluminum are activated by a neutron source to produce isotopes that decay with a half-life of 2.3 minutes emitting a 1.78 MeV gamma ray. These gamma rays are counted in a detector placed below the source, with a high count indicating a high quantity of silicon in a sand pack, or aluminum in a bauxite pack. The log is run slowly so that oxygen and other activated elements have decayed before the detector crosses the activated interval. The carbon-oxygen log, elemental-capture spectroscopy log, pulsed-neutron spectroscopy log, aluminum-activation log and the oxygen-activation log are also examples of neutron-activation logs.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/neutron-activation_log

nuclear fluid densimeter,"A device for measuring the density of fluids in a completed well, using a radioactive source of gamma rays and a detector. In most instruments, a 137Cs (cesium) or 241Am (americium) source is used to induce Compton scattering, as in the openhole density measurement, except that the device is unfocused. The count rate at the detector then depends primarily on the density of the fluids in the well. In some devices, the fluids pass through an open space in the body of the tool within which the measurement is made. The results then reflect the density of the fluids passing through the tool. In other devices, the source and detector are isolated so that the gamma rays pass outside the tool. The results then reflect some average density of all the fluids within the well. In smaller casings, some formation signal may contaminate the measurement. Compared with a gradiomanometer, the nuclear fluid densimeter is a less direct measurement of density, and has a statistical uncertainty and less resolution. On the other hand, it is not affected by well deviation, friction or kinetic effects.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/nuclear_fluid_densimeter
noise log,"A record of the sound measured at different positions in the borehole. Since fluid turbulence generates sound, high noise amplitudes indicate locations of greater turbulence such as leaks, channels and perforations. Noise logging is used primarily for channel detection, but has also been used to measure flow rates, identify open perforations, detect sand production and locate gas-liquid interfaces. The log may be either a continuous record against depth or a series of stationary readings. The log may indicate the total signal over all frequencies, the signal at a single frequency, or consist of a set of logs for different frequency ranges. Different frequency ranges can be tied to different sources of noise or different flow regimes. Although first introduced around 1955, the technique was not used commercially until after laboratory studies in the early 1970s.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/noise_log
optical index,"A measure of the amount of light reflected by a fluid from an optical probe. It is the same as the relative refractive index of light between the probe and the fluid, being close to 1 in gas, 1.35 in water and 1.5 in oil.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/optical_index
optical probe,"A small sensor in a production logging tool that distinguishes the type of fluid in its vicinity as it is moved up and down a production well. The optical probe is sensitive to the optical index of the fluid in front of the probe. It can distinguish easily between gas and liquid, and less easily between oil and water. Light is sent from a source down a fiber-optic cable to the tip of the probe, and reflected back to a sensor, which converts it into an electrical signal. Gas, with a low optical index, reflects a significant amount of light and gives a large signal, while liquids give low signals. As with other local probes, the output is set to be nearly digital, so that the percentage of the time that the probe sees gas is a direct measure of gas holdup in front of the probe. By using several probes, it is possible to obtain the average holdup and an image of the flow structure across the well.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/optical_probe
oxygen activation,"A phenomenon exploited for the purpose of detecting and quantifying the flow of water in or around a borehole based on oxygen activation. Oxygen (16O) can be activated by high-energy neutrons to produce an isotope of nitrogen (16N), which decays back to oxygen with a half-life of 7.1 seconds and emits an easily detected gamma ray of 6.13 MeV. The neutrons are supplied by the generator of a pulsed-neutron spectroscopy tool. The gamma rays are counted in detectors placed above the tool, for upward flow, or below it for downward flow. Various techniques have been developed to analyze the count rates in terms of water velocity, flow rate and distance from tool. The earliest methods were based of the ratio of the counts from two detectors. Stationary oxygen and other background signals are eliminated by calibration in a known zone of zero flow, by counting only in a window near 6.13 MeV, or by optimizing the detector spacings. More recently, impulse-activation techniques have been introduced. While they require the tool to be stationary, they are generally more accurate.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oxygen_activation
photon log,"A record of the density in and around a completed well using a radioactive source of gamma rays and a detector. The log is recorded with a nuclear fluid densimeter. Originally, photon logs were run to determine the size of salt caverns. More recently, they have been run to evaluate the quality of gravel packs and sand cavities, and are then synonymous with gravel-pack logs.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/photon_log
petal basket flowmeter,"A device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well in which the flow is diverted through the spinner by a set of metal vanes, or petals. The vanes are closed while running in the hole, and then opened with the tool stationary at the measurement depth. The petals do not seal completely against each other or against the side of the hole, so that not all the fluid is diverted. A type of diverter flowmeter, the petal basket design has generally been replaced since the late 1980s by the inflatable diverter and other designs.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/petal_basket_flowmeter
phase velocity log,"A record of the velocity with which a particular phase (gas, oil or water) moves in a producing well. While most flowmeters measure some average of all the fluids, the phase-velocity log identifies one particular phase. This is particularly important in highly deviated and horizontal wells with multiphase flow, where the flow structure is complicated. Phase-velocity measurements are made with either the crosscorrelation flowmeter, the water-flow log, or with chemical markers designed to mix specifically with one particular phase. Velocity-shot measurements, using radioactive tracers, have also been used. In a typical chemical marker technique, a gadolinium-rich marker is injected into the flow stream, dissolving in either oil or water. Gadolinium has a high capture cross section, or sigma, so that a slug of fluid with high sigma moves with the appropriate phase up the borehole. This slug can be detected by a standard pulsed-neutron capture tool, and the velocity of the phase computed from the time of flight between ejector and detector.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/phase_velocity_log
plug flow,"A multiphase flow regime in pipes in which most of the gas moves as large bubbles dispersed within a continuous liquid. The bubbles may span much of the pipe. There are also small bubbles within the liquid, but many of these have coalesced to form the larger bubbles, or plugs. In near-horizontal wells, the plugs are also known as elongated bubbles. Plug flow is similar to slug flow, but the bubbles are generally smaller and move more slowly.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/plug_flow
plate out,"To stay on the surface of the formation or a perforation tunnel. When, for example, bead tracers are injected into a well, they will be carried by the injection fluid. Instead of entering the formation with the fluid, the bead tracers will be held, like plates, on the surface.",Verb,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/plate_out
packer flowmeter,"A device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well in which a packer is inflated between the tool housing and the casing wall, causing the total fluid flow to pass inside the tool and over a spinner. The measurement is made with the tool stationary, after borehole fluids have been pumped to inflate the packer. The packer flowmeter was introduced in the mid-1950s. It is a type of diverter flowmeter, but has generally been replaced by petal basket and inflatable diverter flowmeters.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/packer_flowmeter
production log,"A record of one or more in-situ measurements that describe the nature and behavior of fluids in or around the borehole during production or injection. Production logs are run for the purpose of analyzing dynamic well performance and the productivity or injectivity of different zones, diagnosing problem wells, or monitoring the results of a stimulation or completion. The term is sometimes extended to include logs run to measure the physical condition of the well, for example cement bond and corrosion logs. The earliest production logs consisted of temperature logs (1930s) and flowmeters (1940s), to which were soon added fluid-density and capacitance logs (1950s). Flow-rate measurements were gradually improved by the development of tracer logs and improvement to the basic spinner flowmeter. These techniques were adequate for near-vertical wells with single or biphasic flow, but could be misleading in highly deviated, and especially horizontal, wells. New techniques were developed starting in the 1980s. These techniques focused on local probes to measure holdup at different points in the borehole, nuclear techniques to analyze the total holdup of all three phases, and phase-velocity logs for the analysis of individual fluids. At the same time, complex flow structures and flow regimes have been studied more extensively using flow loops.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/production_log
pulsed-neutron holdup log," A record of the fractions, or holdups, of gas, oil and water present at different depths in a producing well using a combination of nuclear measurements recorded by a pulsed-neutron spectroscopy device. The technique is used mainly in deviated and horizontal wells, where the complex flow regimes cause conventional holdup measurements to be inaccurate. The pulsed-neutron spectroscopy measurement is processed to obtain the volume of oil in the borehole rather than the oil in the formation as in a conventional carbon-oxygen measurement. The gas holdup is determined from the ratio of counts received by the near and far detectors in either the inelastic or capture mode, a technique similar to the compensated-neutron log. The water holdup is the remaining fraction. Alternatively, the capture cross section of the borehole can be determined from the pulsed-neutron capture measurement. If the water is saline, and its salinity is known, the water holdup can be determined directly.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pulsed-neutron_holdup_log
ultrasonic caliper,"A device for measuring the internal diameter of a casing, tubing or open borehole using high-frequency acoustic signals. A transducer (in transmit mode) emits a high-frequency pulse that is reflected by the pipe or borehole wall back to the transducer (in receive mode). The diameter is determined from the time of flight of this echo and the fluid acoustic velocity. The transducer is rotated to produce a cross section of the borehole size and full-coverage images of the borehole wall. The measurement has high resolution and is used to detect deformations, the buildup of scale, or metal loss due to corrosion. The amplitude of the echo from the inner casing surface provides qualitative information on the state of the surface, such as rugosity or corrosion. Casing thickness may also be measured simultaneously, either by analysis of the casing resonance signal, or by detecting separately the echoes from the inner and outer casing surfaces.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/ultrasonic_caliper
velocity image,"A two-dimensional display, using colors or different gray scales, of the bubble velocity around the borehole against depth. The x-axis of the image shows different segments of the borehole, normally inside a casing, displayed from the top of the hole clockwise around through the bottom and back to the top again. Depth is in the z-axis, while the values of bubble velocity are represented by different colors or changes from black to white. The velocity image is constructed from between four and eight local probe measurements using interpolation within constraints. Images, sometimes called maps, are also made for bubble count and holdup.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/velocity_image
velocity shot measurement,"A method of producing a radioactive-tracer log, in which a slug of radioactive material is injected into the flow stream of a production or injection well from one section of a logging tool and observed as it passes one or more gamma ray detectors in another section. The slug, or shot, causes a peak in the gamma ray reading as it passes a detector. The flow velocity is determined from the difference in the time of arrival of the slug at the two detectors, or between ejector and detector. This technique has been applied for many years using radioactive tracers such as iodine. Water-soluble tracers are the most common, but oil- and gas-soluble tracers are also used. Velocity-shot measurements are recorded with the tool stationary. They are more accurate than flowmeters at low flow rates, below approximately 100 B/D [16m3/d]. They are not usually run in production wells because of problems of tracer disposal. In multiphase flow, the tracer most often travels with the continuous phase, thereby giving a type of phase-velocity log.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/velocity_shot_measurement
velocity map,"Another term for velocity image, a two-dimensional display, using colors or different gray scales, of the bubble velocity around the borehole against depth. The x-axis of the image shows different segments of the borehole, normally inside a casing, displayed from the top of the hole clockwise around through the bottom and back to the top again. Depth is in the z-axis, while the values of bubble velocity are represented by different colors or changes from black to white. The velocity image is constructed from between four and eight local probe measurements using interpolation within constraints. Images, sometimes called maps, are also made for bubble count and holdup.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/velocity_map
velocity correction factor,"The factor linking the velocity of single-phase liquid flow measured in the center of a pipe with the average velocity across the pipe. For vertical pipes with turbulent flow measured by standard flowmeters, the velocity-correction factor varies within a range of 0.75 to 0.95, but is often taken as 0.83. For laminar flow, it is theoretically 0.5.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/velocity_correction_factor
wall loss,"The loss of material on the inside or outside of a casing or tubing due to corrosion. Monitoring wall loss in situ helps determine when the pipe may be at risk for leaking or failure. Wall loss is determined by comparing casing or tubing thickness measured by electromagnetic, acoustic resonance or mechanical methods with either an earlier measurement or an assumed value.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wall_loss
water-flow log,"A record of the velocity and direction of water flowing in and around a borehole based on oxygen activation. The log may also include estimates of the flow volume and the distance from tool to flowing water. Water, and occasionally carbon dioxide, is the only source of moving oxygen in and around the borehole. Hence, water flow can be detected by oxygen activation, which, being a nuclear technique, is sensitive to flow inside and outside the casing. The measurement is sensitive to small flows, and can be configured to measure upward or downward flow. It is particularly useful as a leak and channel detector, to identify locations of water entry or exit and as a measurement of water velocity in multiphase flow. Logs may be continuous, but the most accurate measurements are made with the tool stationary. Although first tried in the 1960s, the log was not fully studied and implemented until the late 1970s with a purpose-built experimental tool. Standard pulsed-neutron spectroscopy tools were modified to record the log in the 1980s.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/water-flow_log
water-cut meter,"A device for determining the water holdup in a producing well by measuring the capacitance or impedance of the fluid. The term is a misnomer because water cut is not the same as water holdup except in the unlikely case where all phases flow at the same velocity. Since hydrocarbons travel faster than water in a production well, the water holdup is larger than the water cut. However, the water-cut meter was often combined with a flowmeter so that the water cut could be estimated by combining the two measurements.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/water-cut_meter
annular flow,"A multiphase flow regime in which the lighter fluid flows in the center of the pipe, and the heavier fluid is contained in a thin film on the pipe wall. The lighter fluid may be a mist or an emulsion. Annular flow occurs at high velocities of the lighter fluid, and is observed in both vertical and horizontal wells. As the velocity increases, the film may disappear, leading to mist flow or emulsion flow. When the interface between the fluids is irregular, the term wavy annular flow may be used.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/annular_flow
audio measurement,"A technique for recording sound at different positions in the borehole to generate a noise log. The measurement technique uses a microphone to record signals in the audible range approximately 20 to 20,000 Hz . In some circumstances, the frequency of the signal can be related to the source of noise and the flow regime, while the amplitude of the signal can be related to the flow rate. The useful signal lies approximately between 100 and 5,000 Hz, with lower frequencies generally representing background and mechanical noise. The measurement may record the total signal over all frequencies, the signal at a single frequency, or a set of measurements over different frequency ranges.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/audio_measurement
stratified flow,"A multiphase-flow regime in horizontal or near-horizontal wells in which the fluids are separated into different layers, with lighter fluids flowing above heavier fluids. Stratified flow is more likely to occur at low flow rates and in flat or downhill sections of horizontal wells. In uphill sections, and as the flow rate increases, the interface between the fluids becomes mixed and irregular, hence the term wavy stratified flow is often used.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stratified_flow
superficial velocity,"The velocity of fluid moving through a pipe, defined as the volumetric flow rate of that fluid divided by the cross-sectional area. In monophasic flow, it is equal to the mean velocity of the fluid. In multiphase flow, it is not a physically real velocity but is a convenient parameter for analysis.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/superficial_velocity
spinner flowmeter,"A device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well based on the speed of rotation of an impeller, or spinner. The spinner can be helical, that is, longer than it is wide, or like a vane, which is similar to a fan blade. In both cases, the speed of rotation is measured and related to the effective velocity of the fluid. Friction and fluid viscosity cause the relationship to be slightly nonlinear at low effective velocities and introduce a threshold velocity below which the spinner does not turn. Results are interpreted using the multipass, two-pass or single-pass methods. There are several types of spinner flowmeter. The most common device uses a small vane-like spinner, about 1.5 in. [3.8 cm] in diameter, allowing the logging tool to pass through the tubing and other restrictions before reaching the reservoir interval. The small spinner captures only part of the fluid flow in the casing, too little to make it turn in some low flow-rate wells and possibly unrepresentative in multiphase flow settings. Other devices have been designed to capture more of the flow, for example the fullbore spinner and various types of flow-concentrating or diverter spinners, such as the packer flowmeter and the basket flowmeter.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spinner_flowmeter
slip velocity,"The difference between the average velocities of two different fluids flowing together in a pipe. In vertical ascending flow, the lighter fluid flows faster than the heavier fluid. The slip velocity depends mainly on the difference in density between the two fluids, and their holdups.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/slip_velocity
slip,"The phenomenon in multiphase flow when one phase flows faster than another phase, in other words slips past it. Because of this phenomenon, there is a difference between the holdups and cuts of the phases.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/slip
single-pass method,"A technique for interpreting the results from a spinner flowmeter using only one logging run over the zone of interest. Spinner speed is related to fluid velocity using laboratory-determined values for threshold velocity and spinner response. The single-pass method is generally considered inferior to the in-situ multipass or two-pass method. However, in highly deviated and horizontal wells, where the logging tools must be deployed using coiled tubing or a tractor, the cost of an additional pass is high. Single-pass interpretation, with improved spinner characterization, has therefore become more common in recent years.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/single-pass_method
slug flow,"A multiphase-fluid flow regime characterized by a series of liquid plugs (slugs) separated by a relatively large gas pockets. In vertical flow, the bubble is an axially symmetrical bullet shape that occupies almost the entire cross-sectional area of the tubing. The resulting flow alternates between high-liquid and high-gas composition.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/slug_flow
single phase,"The only component of a flow or other phenomenon, normally oil, water or gas.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/single_phase
single-phase,"Referring to a flow or other phenomenon with only one component, normally oil, water or gas.",Adjective,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/single-phase
spinner reversal,"The change in direction of rotation that occurs when a spinner flowmeter tool is moving in the same direction, but faster, than the fluid. When the tool is stationary, moving against the fluid flow, or moving in the same direction but slower than the flow, it will rotate in one direction, perhaps clockwise. However, if it moves in the same direction, but faster than the fluid, it will rotate counterclockwise. This may happen at the bottom of a producing well, and, unless identified, can lead to a false interpretation.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spinner_reversal
tracer measurement,"A technique in which a tracer is injected into the flow stream of a production or injection well to determine fluid paths and velocities. Radioactive tracers have been used from the 1940s and are still common for determining flow profiles in injection wells. Tracers with high neutron-capture cross section, such as borax or high-salinity water, were introduced in the 1970s to record injection/pulsed neutron logs. In multiphase production wells, special tracers were introduced in the 1990s to move with only one phase, so as to give a phase-velocity log. Radioactive tracers with different energies are used to track the development of fractures, or other processes, in the multiple-isotope log. Tracer measurements are used qualitatively to determine the movement of fluids behind pipe, or quantitatively to determine fluid-flow velocity within the pipe.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tracer_measurement
Taylor bubbles,"In multiphase flow, large bubbles of the lighter phase that form by coalescence of small bubbles under certain conditions of fluid flow. The large bubbles occur during slug flow and plug flow. The term is named after G.I. Taylor.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/taylor_bubbles
Taitel–Dukler,"Referring to the description of different regimes for the simultaneous flow of gas and liquid in vertical pipes introduced by Y. Taitel and A. Dukler in 1980. The results are shown in the form of a crossplot or map with the superficial gas velocity, vgs, on the x-axis and the superficial liquid velocity, vls, on the y-axis. Different maps are constructed for different pipe sizes and fluid properties. The Taitel–Dukler map defines the transition between different flow regimes more closely than other models. Taitel and Dukler also described flow transitions in horizontal pipes.

temperature log,"A record of the temperature gradient in a well. The temperature log is interpreted by looking for anomalies, or departures, from the reference gradient. This reference might be the geothermal gradient, a log recorded before production started or a log recorded with the well shut-in. Most anomalies are related to the entry of fluids into the borehole or fluid exit into the formation. Since the temperature is affected by material outside the casing, a temperature log is sensitive to not only the borehole but also the formation and the casing-formation annulus. Temperature logs have many applications, with the most common being to identify zones producing or taking fluid, to evaluate a cement or hydraulic fracture treatment, and to locate lost circulation zones and casing leaks. Since temperature takes time to dissipate, a temperature log tends to reflect the behavior of a well over a longer time period than other measurements.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/temperature_log
two-pass method,"A technique for interpreting the results from a spinner flowmeter using two logging runs over the zone of interest, one up and one down. If the two passes are run at the same cable speed, they will overlay below the perforations, where there is no flow. If they were not run at the same speed, the curves are shifted to overlay. Elsewhere, the separation between the curves gives the relative contribution of each zone. Viscosity changes should have a small effect, since they will have the same influence on both passes. The technique is applicable when the flow is single-phase, or else multiphase with a sufficiently homogeneous-flow regime, such as with emulsion or dispersed bubble flow.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/two-pass_method
turbulent flow,"A fluid-flow regime characterized by swirling or chaotic motion as the fluid moves along the pipe or conduit. The linear velocity of the fluid particles is similar regardless of position in the conduit, although particles close to the conduit walls have a lower velocity. This characteristic makes turbulent flow an efficient flow regime for the pickup and transport of solids. However, the potential for erosion may be significant, especially with abrasive fluids and a tortuous flow path.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/turbulent_flow
tracer,A chemical or other material placed in the borehole fluid and later detected to infer information about the borehole or the drilled formations. The two main types of tracers used during drilling are the mud tracer and the filtrate tracer.,Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tracer
tracer-ejector measurement,"Another term for velocity-shot measurement, a method of producing a radioactive-tracer log, in which a slug of radioactive material is injected into the flow stream of a production or injection well from one section of a logging tool and observed as it passes one or more gamma ray detectors in another section. The slug, or shot, causes a peak in the gamma ray reading as it passes a detector. The flow velocity is determined from the difference in the time of arrival of the slug at the two detectors, or between ejector and detector. This technique has been applied for many years using radioactive tracers such as iodine. Water-soluble tracers are the most common, but oil- and gas-soluble tracers are also used. Velocity-shot measurements are recorded with the tool stationary. They are more accurate than flowmeters at low flow rates, below approximately 100 bbl/d [16 m3/d]. They are not usually run in production wells because of problems of tracer disposal. In multiphase flow, the tracer most often travels with the continuous phase, thereby giving a type of phase-velocity log.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tracer-ejector_measurement
torque flowmeter,"A device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well based on the torque, or force, produced by the fluid on a stationary impeller. This torque can be related to the effective velocity of flow across the impeller. The torque flowmeter is sometimes used as an alternative to the spinner flowmeter.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/torque_flowmeter
tracer-loss measurement,"A method of determining injection-flow profiles by monitoring the reduction in tracer material as it moves down the well. A slug of radioactive tracer is added to the injection fluid. As the slug moves down the well, several gamma ray logs are recorded at well-defined time intervals. The position of the slug is seen as a large gamma ray peak whose size is proportional to the flow rate. A reduction in the size of the peak indicates a loss of fluid into the formation. Fluid velocity can be calculated from the time interval and the distance the peak has moved using timed-slug analysis. Tracer-loss measurements produce a type of radioactive-tracer log, used mainly to give a general idea of fluid flow in low flow-rate wells. In very low flow-rate wells, an alternative technique has been used in which the gamma ray detector is held stationary at some depth until the slug has passed. The detector is then moved down to another depth to observe the slug again. With these data, it is possible to make quantitative estimates of fluid flow.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tracer-loss_measurement
threshold velocity,"In a spinner flowmeter, the theoretical minimum fluid velocity required to initiate spinner rotation, assuming the spinner response is linear. The actual fluid velocity required to start spinner rotation is slightly higher because of additional viscous and mechanical effects. The threshold velocity is determined by extrapolating the spinner response at higher fluid velocities, where it is known to be nearly linear, back to the value that exists when spinner rotation is zero.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/threshold_velocity
timed slug analysis,"A technique for determining the velocity of fluid flow in an injection well based on measuring the time a slug of radioactive tracer takes to move down the well. The analysis is usually performed as part of a tracer-loss measurement. The depth of the slug is measured by running repeated gamma ray logs at well-defined time intervals. From the differences in depth and time, the velocity can be determined.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/timed_slug_analysis
metal gain,"The apparent increase in thickness of a casing or tubing string compared to the assumed value. Metal gain is determined by electromagnetic thickness, acoustic resonance, or mechanical methods. The apparent increase is usually due a change of hardware, such as a casing coupling, a heavier joint, a pup joint, a mandrel, or a valve. The term is used in contrast to metal loss caused by corrosion.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/metal_gain
metal loss,"The loss of material on the inside or outside of a casing or tubing due to corrosion. Monitoring metal loss in situ helps determine when the pipe may be at risk for leaking or failure. Metal loss is determined by comparing casing or tubing thickness measured by electromagnetic, acoustic resonance, or mechanical methods with either an earlier measurement or an assumed value.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/metal_loss
magnetic-flux leakage,"A distortion of the magnetic flux that has been introduced into a casing by a low-frequency electromagnet or permanent magnet. The principle of flux leakage is used to detect casing corrosion, since flux leakage is caused by rapid changes in the thickness of the casing and by pits and holes in either the internal or external wall. Flux leakage distorts the magnetic-flux lines and induces a signal into an electric coil moving past it. In-situ flux-leakage measurements make use of this effect by placing coils on or close to the casing wall, azimuthally distributed to cover the entire wall. The results are often combined with a high-frequency, eddy-current measurement, designed to detect flaws only on the inner wall.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/magnetic-flux_leakage
multiple-isotope log,"A record of the quantity of different radioactive isotopes near the borehole. The technique used is the same as for natural gamma ray spectroscopy, but measures the quantities of various short half-life radioactive tracers in addition to natural gamma rays. The log is run to monitor the results of processes that can be tagged, for example, hydraulic fracturing, gravel-pack placement, squeeze cementing, acid treatment and lost-circulation detection. Different radioactive tracers are added at different stages of the process so that by measuring the different tracers, it is possible to track the development, for example, of the fracture. The most common radioactive tracers are 110Ag (silver), 195Au (gold), 135I (iodine), 192Ir (iridium), 124Sb (antimony), and 46Sc (scandium).",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiple-isotope_log
multicapacitance flowmeter,"A device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well by measuring the transit time of a disturbance between two dielectric sensors a fixed distance apart. The device is a type of crosscorrelation flowmeter that uses several pairs of capacitance, or dielectric, sensors held on an arm to span the borehole.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multi-capacitance_flowmeter
multiphase holdup log,"A record of the fractions, or holdups, of gas, oil and water present at different depths in a producing well using a combination of nuclear measurements recorded by a pulsed-neutron spectroscopy device. The technique is used mainly in deviated and horizontal wells, where the complex flow regimes cause conventional holdup measurements to be inaccurate. The pulsed-neutron spectroscopy measurement is processed to obtain the volume of oil in the borehole rather than the oil in the formation as in a conventional carbon-oxygen measurement. The gas holdup is determined from the ratio of counts received by the near and far detectors in either the inelastic or capture mode, a technique similar to the compensated-neutron log. The water holdup is the remaining fraction. Alternatively, the capture cross section of the borehole can be determined from the pulsed-neutron capture measurement. If the water is saline, and its salinity is known, the water holdup can be determined directly.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiphase_holdup_log
multiple-isotope spectroscopy,The technique used to produce a multiple-isotope log.,Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiple-isotope_spectroscopy
multifinger caliper,"A device for measuring the diameter of the internal wall of a casing or tubing using multiple arms. By using a large number of arms, or fingers, the caliper can detect small changes in the wall of the pipe. The main purpose of the measurement is to detect deformations, the buildup of scale or metal loss due to corrosion. Typical multifinger calipers have between about 20 and 80 fingers, the larger numbers being necessary in larger pipes.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multifinger_caliper
mist flow,"A multiphase fluid-flow regime characterized by the gas phase being distributed as bubbles through the liquid phase. In a producing wellbore where the bubbles are uniformly distributed, there is little relative motion between the phases. Where the bubbles congregate and combine to form a less uniform distribution of the gas phase, some slippage will occur between the phases with the gas tending to cut through the liquid phase.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mist_flow
multipass method,"A technique for interpreting the results from a spinner flowmeter using several logging runs of the flowmeter over the zone of interest at different speeds, both up and down. Spinner speed is a nearly linear function of the effective velocity of the fluid. Although this function can be measured on surface, it varies with the fluid and is most reliably determined in situ. After several passes are made, the function can be calibrated and the spinner speed converted into flow rate. The technique is applicable when the flow is single phase, or else multiphase with a sufficiently homogeneous flow regime such as with emulsion or dispersed bubble flow.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multipass_method
multiphase,"Referring to a fluid with several different immiscible fluids (oil, water or gas).",Adjective,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiphase
electromagnetic thickness,"An in-situ measurement of the thickness of a casing or tubing string using an electromagnetic technique. The result is presented as a type of casing-inspection log, giving an estimate of metal loss and detecting corrosion. In the usual method, a coil centered inside the casing generates an alternating magnetic field. Another coil farther up the tool measures the phase shift introduced by the casing. This phase shift depends on the casing-wall thickness and internal diameter, as well as the casing conductivity and magnetic permeability. The effects change at different frequencies, so that by varying the frequency, the thickness and internal diameter can be uniquely determined. Electromagnetic thickness can also be measured using other techniques, for example from a casing-potential profile or a flux-leakage measurement.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electromagnetic_thickness
effective velocity,"In the context of spinner flowmeters, the apparent fluid speed measured by the spinner as the tool is moved up and down the well. The effective velocity is the algebraic sum of the actual fluid velocity and the velocity with which the flowmeter is moving, as determined by cable speed. If the tool moves against the flow, the two velocities are added; if moved with the flow, they are subtracted.",Noun,Production Logging,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/effective_velocity
