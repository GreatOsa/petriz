wireline,Related to any aspect of logging that employs an electrical cable to lower tools into the borehole and to transmit data. Wireline logging is distinct from measurements-while-drilling (MWD) and mud logging.,Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wireline
estimated ultimate recovery,"The amount of oil and gas expected to be economically recovered from a reservoir or field by the end of its producing life. Estimated ultimate recovery can be referenced to a well, a field, or a basin.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/estimated_ultimate_recovery
epithermal neutron porosity measurement,"A measurement based on the slowing down of neutrons between a source and one or more detectors that measure neutrons at the epithermal level, where their energy is above that of the surrounding matter, between approximately 0.4 and 10 eV. The slowing-down process is dominated by hydrogen, and is characterized by a slowing-down length. By measuring the neutrons at the epithermal level, rather than the thermal level, the response is a purer estimate of hydrogen index, unaffected by thermal absorbers. On the other hand, the count rate is smaller for the same source and source-detector spacing. Epithermal measurements have been made with both the compensated neutron technique and by using a pad pressed against the borehole wall with detectors focused into the formation.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/epithermal_neutron_porosity_measurement
environmental corrections,"The adjustments that must be made to log measurements to bring them back to the standard conditions for which the tool has been characterized. Different measurements require different corrections. For example resistivity measurements usually require correction for the borehole, invasion and shoulder beds, and may also be corrected for apparent dip, anisotropy and surrounding beds in horizontal wells. Density measurements require correction only for borehole size, while neutron porosity measurements require corrections for temperature, pressure and a large number of borehole and formation parameters. Not all corrections are significant in all cases. Corrections can be calculated manually, using charts, or applied through software. Conventionally, corrections are applied sequentially, as for example first borehole then invasion. In some situations, such as the combination of deep invasion and high apparent dip on a resistivity measurement, the corrections are too interdependent for sequential application to be accurate. The solution is iterative forward modeling.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/environmental_corrections
endfire array,"A particular arrangement of transmitters and receivers used in the electromagnetic propagation measurement in which the dipoles used as sensors are oriented along the axis of the tool. The orientation is combined with relatively long spacings to give deeper penetration, and hence less effect of mudcake or rugosity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/endfire_array
excavation effect,"That part of the effect of gas on the neutron porosity measurement that is not explained by differences in hydrogen index. By using the concept of hydrogen index, the only significant contributor to the neutron porosity in a gas zone is the liquid-filled porosity, since the hydrogen indices of gas and matrix are close to zero. However, the resultant liquid-filled porosity is found to be too low. The error comes from treating the gas-filled porosity as matrix. If this matrix is excavated and replaced with gas, the correct response can be predicted.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/excavation_effect
enhanced diffusion,"A technique in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging based on a long echo spacing, specially chosen to enhance the diffusion of formation water. Echo spacings in standard NMR logs are too short to allow any significant diffusion relaxation from water. Long echo spacings, for example 3 s, cause diffusion relaxation to limit the maximum T2 from water. They also limit the maximum T2 from light hydrocarbons. However, there is a certain range of viscosity of medium oil that is less affected. The enhanced diffusion technique therefore permits the identification of some medium oils.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/enhanced_diffusion
equivalent water resistivity,"The effective resistivity of the formation water or the mud filtrate, as it affects the electrochemical potential. The electrochemical potential is the main source of the spontaneous potential log. The equivalent water resistivity, or equivalent resistivity, is defined as the reciprocal of the activity of a solution, so that the formula for the electrochemical potential, Ec, can be written as: Ec = - K log10 (Rmfe / Rwe) where K is a coefficient, and Rmfe and Rwe are the equivalent water resistivities. The importance of Rmfe and Rwe is that they are equal to the actual water resistivities for NaCl solutions above about 0.1 ohm-m. In salty waters below 0.1ohm-m, the equivalent resistivity is lower by an amount that depends on temperature and salinity. In fresh waters, divalent ions such as Ca++ and Mg++ have a strong effect on Ec. Rwe is then related to Rw by an empirical transform that assumes average concentrations of these ions. For fresh mud filtrates, it has been common practice to set Rmfe = 0.85 * Rmf.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/equivalent_water_resistivity
equivalent conductance,"With reference to the conductivity of brines, the ionic conductivity provided by a unit ion concentration. The conductivity of the brine (Cw, in siemens per meter or S/m) is determined by the equivalent conductance, (B, in S/m per meq/cm3) and the ion concentration (N, in milli-ion equivalent, or more commonly milliequivalent, meq per cm3) as Cw = B * N.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/equivalent_conductance
electromagnetic propagation measurement,"A measurement of the high frequency (about 1 GHz) dielectric properties of the formation. In a typical tool, a microwave transmitter is placed a few inches below two receivers separated by 4 cm [1.6 in.]. At this frequency, the response is best explained as the propagation of a wave. Thus the phase shift and attenuation of the wave between the receivers are measured and transformed to give the log measurements of propagation time and attenuation. Because of the short spacings, the measurement has excellent vertical resolution and reads within inches of the borehole wall except at high resistivity. Different transmitter and receiver spacings and orientations are used, leading to different arrays, such as the endfire array and the broadside array. An ideal measurement would give the plane wave properties of the formation. However, the geometry of the measurement precludes this, so that a correction, known as the spreading-loss correction, is needed for the attenuation and to a much smaller extent for the propagation time. The measurement is also affected by the dielectric properties and thickness of the mudcake. Borehole compensation is used to correct for sonde tilt or a rough borehole wall.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electromagnetic_propagation_measurement
electromagnetic propagation,"Pertaining to logs that measure the properties of electromagnetic waves as they move through a formation. Measurements-while-drilling (MWD) propagation resistivity logs work between about 100 kHz and 10 MHz. Dielectric propagation logs work between 20 and 200 MHz. Logs made above 200 MHz and into the GHz range are known as electromagnetic propagation logs. Below about 100 kHz, the measurements are based on the properties of standing waves, not of propagation. Induction and laterolog tools work in this range.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electromagnetic_propagation
electrical anisotropy,"A difference in vertical and horizontal resistivity within a formation and at the scale of the resistivity measurement. Although there are several possible types of anisotropy, the term usually is used when the electrical properties are the same in all horizontal directions but different in the vertical direction. For horizontal beds, this type of anisotropy is more fully known as transverse isotropy with a vertical axis of symmetry (TIV). The term may also refer to a difference in resistivities measured parallel and perpendicular to bedding.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electrical_anisotropy
eccentralizer,"A device that helps to keep a wireline logging tool away from the center of the borehole. Typical devices are a single bow spring mounted on the outside surface of the logging tool or a set of rubber fingers mounted at the bottom. Some measurements, such as induction logs, respond better when the tool is eccentralized, while others, including acoustic logs, are better when centralized.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/eccentralizer
electrode resistivity,"The resistivity measured by an electrode device. The term often is used to distinguish this resistivity from that measured by the measurements-while-drilling propagation resistivity, or the wireline induction resistivity. The term may also refer to measurements-while-drilling toroid devices, such as bit resistivity, ring resistivity, and button resistivity. These devices do not use electrodes but have a similar response. Electrode resistivity measurements respond to resistivity, not conductivity. They are therefore best at measuring true formation resistivity at high resistivities, high contrasts in resistivity between formation and drilling mud, and for conductive invasion. These are conditions that are not well covered by propagation and induction resistivity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electrode_resistivity
electrode device,"A logging tool based on an arrangement of simple metallic electrodes working at low frequency (less than 500 Hz). The term includes conventional electrical logs, laterologs, micrologs and other microresistivity logs. Electrode devices are used for both wireline and measurements-while-drilling logs. In all electrode devices, a current (IO) and a voltage (VO) are measured on the appropriate electrodes or combinations of electrodes. The apparent formation resistivity is then determined by: Ra = K VO / IO, where K is a system constant for the device concerned.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electrode_device
electrical survey,"A particular combination of a spontaneous potential log and three electrical logs consisting of a 16-in. [40-cm] short normal, a 64-in. [162-cm] long normal and an 18-ft, 8-in. [5.7-m] lateral. With this combination, it is possible to correct for the effects of invasion in many average logging environments. This combination is sometimes called a conventional electrical log or survey, or simply electrical log, and is also referred to as the ES.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electrical_survey
electrokinetic potential,"The electromagnetic force, in millivolts, generated by an electrolyte flowing through a permeable medium. This potential is an unwanted contribution to the spontaneous potential (SP) log. In principle, there is no flow into a permeable reservoir at the time of logging, since the mudcake has isolated the reservoir from the borehole. However, it is possible for mudcakes and shales to produce an electrokinetic potential at the time of logging. In normal conditions, any potential is small and equal along the borehole, so that the effect on the SP is negligible. A significant electrokinetic potential can be generated in particular conditions, for example, high differential pressure or poor mudcakes.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electrokinetic_potential
electrical log,"A log recorded using an electrical wireline. In this sense, the term refers to any log recorded on a wireline, whether it measures an electrical quantity or not. The term dates from the early days of logging when the only logs were the spontaneous potential and resistivity from conventional electrode devices.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electrical_log
electrical double layer,"With reference to formation evaluation, the layer between a clay particle and the formation water that has a particular distribution of ions. Clays have an excess negative charge on their surface. When in contact with formation water, this charge attracts an excess of positive cations, normally Na+ together with their molecules of hydration water, into a region near the interface. The layer next to the clay surface, the Stern layer, has no anions, and is always present. Outside the Stern layer is the Gouy layer, through which the ion concentration gradually approaches that of free brine. The thickness of this layer increases as brine salinity decreases.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/electrical_double_layer
echo spacing,"The time between each echo in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement. The time is also the time to the first echo and is therefore an important parameter in defining the fastest relaxation time that can be measured. In standard measurements, the echo spacing ranges from 0.2 to 1 ms.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/echo_spacing
elemental capture spectroscopy,"Referring to a log of the yields of different elements in the formation, as measured by capture gamma ray spectroscopy using a pulsed neutron generator. The log is a type of pulsed neutron spectroscopy log that uses only the capture spectrum. The capture spectrum is formed by many elements, but since the main purpose of the log is to determine lithology, the principal outputs are the relative yields of silicon, calcium, iron, sulfur, titanium and gadolinium. The yields give information only on the relative concentration of these elements. To get absolute elemental concentrations, it is necessary to calibrate to cores, or, more often, use a model such as the oxide-closure model. The depth of investigation of the measurement is several inches into the formation. It can be run in open or cased hole. The absolute elemental concentrations are insensitive to fluids in the borehole and formation.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/elemental_capture_spectroscopy
elastic neutron scattering,"A neutron interaction in which the kinetic energy lost by a neutron in a nuclear collision is transferred to the nucleus. The energy of a neutron is reduced more efficiently in collisions with nuclei of similar mass to the neutron, like hydrogen and other elements of low atomic mass. Elastic neutron scattering is one of the main principles behind the neutron porosity log, as well as the pulsed neutron capture log, which is mainly used to determine water saturation behind casing.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/elastic_neutron_scattering
fishing bell,"Also known as the head, the device that connects the end of the logging cable or the bridle to the top of the logging tool. It contains the weak point, so that when the weak point is broken and the cable removed, the uppermost assembly left in the hole is the head. The top of the head is specially designed to ease fishing of the logging tool.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fishing_bell
fish,"Anything left in a wellbore. It does not matter whether the fish consists of junk metal, a hand tool, a length of drillpipe or drill collars, or an expensive MWD and directional drilling package. Once the component is lost, it is properly referred to as simply ""the fish."" Typically, anything put into the hole is accurately measured and sketched, so that appropriate fishing tools can be selected if the item must be fished out of the hole.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fish
first reading,"The depth of the first reliable reading of a curve on a log. For the typical bottom-to-top survey, the curve readings before the tool is picked up from the bottom of the hole are not reliable--they are straight lines that do not represent the formation at the depth indicated. With several logging tools in a tool string, the first reading of each curve will be at a different depth, depending on the measure point of each tool.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/first_reading
fast formation,"A formation where the velocity of the compressional wave traveling through the borehole fluid is less than the velocity of the shear wave through the surrounding formation. In such conditions a shear head wave is generated, so that standard techniques based on monopole transducers can be used to measure formation shear velocity. In hard formations, several normal modes are excited in addition to the Stoneley and leaky modes.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fast_formation
flexural mode,"A type of acoustic propagation along the borehole that is visualized as a shaking of the borehole across its diameter. The flexural mode is excited by a dipole source, and measured by dipole receivers oriented in the same direction. Its speed is chiefly a function of the formation shear velocity, the borehole size and fluid velocity, and the frequency. It is used to estimate formation shear velocity, and is the only technique available in slow formations where shear velocity is less than borehole-fluid velocity. In this situation, shear head waves are not generated by a monopole source, so that standard monopole techniques cannot be used. The flexural wave is sensitive to properties of the altered zone, as well as to formation anisotropy, whether intrinsic or stress-induced.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flexural_mode
filtrate slump,"The downward vertical movement of filtrate with time after invasion. In hydrocarbon zones, the filtrate is heavier than the formation fluid. Therefore, in a vertical well, gravity causes the filtrate to sink to the bottom of a permeable zone, while the hydrocarbons move back to the borehole at the top. In a horizontal well, the mud filtrate will sink below the well, leaving hydrocarbons above it. The amount of movement depends, among other factors, on the time since invasion, the fluid mobilities and the difference in fluid densities. In water zones, the direction of movement depends on the relative densities of filtrate and formation water. In the more usual case of fresh filtrate and salty formation water, the filtrate will move upwards.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/filtrate_slump
free water,"Water that is mobile, available to flow, and not bound to surfaces of grains or minerals in rock.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/free_water
fast diffusion,"The rapid rate of diffusion of molecules in pore fluids during a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement. In fast diffusion, the hydrogen within a certain volume diffuses fast enough that only one T2 peak is observed for the whole volume. This is the case in a single pore, because the surface relaxation is not strong enough for observation of separate T2 peaks, for example, for water near the surface of a grain and water in the middle of the pore. Fast diffusion is also considered to occur between most clay- and capillary-bound water, between normal pores and micropores within some carbonates, and in some other systems.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fast_diffusion
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,"A technique for quantitative mineralogical analysis of a sample of rock by measuring the effect of midrange infrared radiation transmitted through the sample. This radiation excites vibrations in the chemical bonds within the mineral molecules at particular frequencies characteristic of each bond. The transmitted radiation is compared with the spectral standards for a wide variety of minerals to determine the abundance of each mineral in the sample. Typically, a core plug is ground finely and a small (approximately 1 g) representative sample selected and dispersed in a potassium bromide matrix for the measurement.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fourier_transform_infrared_spectroscopy
fast-neutron reaction,"A neutron interaction in which the neutron is absorbed by the target nuclei, which then emit nuclear particles such as alpha or beta particles, gamma rays, protons or additional neutrons. Fast neutron reactions have a small probability of occurrence relative to the other principal interactions, except at high neutron energy.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fast-neutron_reaction
far water,"Water that is far from the clay surface, as distinct from clay-bound water (or ""near"" water). The term is used in the dual-water model. It includes the capillary-bound water and the free water.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/far_water
fast-formation arrival,"An early signal in a cement-bond log. In some formations, particularly carbonates of low porosity, it is possible that the first acoustic signal to arrive at the receiver passes through the formation rather than through the casing, and hence its amplitude is unrelated to the cement bond. This manifests itself by a shortening of the transmitter-to-receiver traveltime and by anomalous patterns on the variable-density log. In such cases, it may be assumed that the cement bond is good, as the signal would be unlikely to be transmitted through the formation with sufficient amplitude to be detected if cement bond were poor.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fast-formation_arrival
FTIR,A method for obtaining quantitative mineralogical analysis of a rock sample by measuring the effect of midrange infrared radiation transmitted through the sample.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/ftir
full waveform,"A log or a recording in which the complete signal received at an acoustic transducer is recorded. With full-waveform recording, it is possible to determine the slowness not only of the first arrival but also of later arrivals. In borehole sonic logging, these may be the shear, flexural and Stoneley waves. The waveforms are recorded by an array of receivers in an array-sonic tool, and processed with a suitable technique such as slowness-time coherence.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/full_waveform
fresh water,"Formation water with low salinity. Water is considered fresh when its low conductivity makes the interpretation of resistivity logs difficult. The salinity at which this becomes important depends on temperature and clay content, among other factors, but is generally somewhere less than 10 ppk.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fresh_water
fresh core,"A core that is in the same state as when it was brought to the surface. A fresh core is sealed as soon as possible after retrieval from the well to minimize the loss of fluids and exposure to air. The term implies that the core is analyzed before being stored, after storage it is known as preserved core. Since the purpose is to minimize alteration, a fresh core has often been drilled with a bland mud, either water- or oil-base, but with a minimum of chemical additives and weighting material.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fresh_core
filtrate,"The liquid that passes through a filter cake from a slurry held against the filter medium, driven by differential pressure. Dynamic or static filtration can produce a filtrate.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/filtrate
forward modeling,"The technique of determining what a given sensor would measure in a given formation and environment by applying a set of theoretical equations for the sensor response. Forward modeling is used to determine the general response of most electromagnetic logging measurements, unlike nuclear measurements whose response is determined mainly in laboratory experiments. Forward modeling is also used for interpretation, particularly in horizontal wells and complex environments. In this case, iterative forward modeling is used. The set of theoretical equations (the forward models) can be 1D, 2D or 3D. The more complex the geometry, the more factors can be modeled but the slower the computing time.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/forward_modeling
free-induction decay,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, the decay, or relaxation, caused by dephasing in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Since this relaxation is not related to formation properties, it is unwanted and corrected by using the CPMG pulse sequence.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/free-induction_decay
formation water,"Water that occurs naturally within the pores of rock. Water from fluids introduced to a formation through drilling or other interference, such as mud and seawater, does not constitute formation water. Formation water, or interstitial water, might not have been the water present when the rock originally formed. In contrast, connate water is the water trapped in the pores of a rock during its formation, and may be called fossil water.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_water
free fluid,"Fluid in the pore space that can flow under normal reservoir conditions. This fluid may include water, oil or gas, and will flow on production, injection or invasion. When the term is used in connection with nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, it refers to the signal that occurs above a certain cutoff, typically 33 ms in sandstones and 100 ms in carbonates. The source of this signal is free water and oil with a viscosity below about 60 cp in sandstones, and 30 cp in carbonates. Note that, contrary to the sense of ""free,"" this oil may or may not be residual under normal reservoir conditions.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/free_fluid
formation,"The fundamental unit of lithostratigraphy. A body of rock that is sufficiently distinctive and continuous that it can be mapped. In stratigraphy, a formation is a body of strata of predominantly one type or combination of types; multiple formations form groups, and subdivisions of formations are members.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation
formation exposure time,"The time that has elapsed between the bit first penetrating a formation and a log being recorded opposite the formation. In logging-while-drilling operations, this time is different for each log, since it depends on the drilling rate and the distance between the bit and the particular logging sensor.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_exposure_time
formation evaluation,"The measurement and analysis of formation and fluid properties through examination of formation cuttings or through the use of tools integrated into the bottomhole assembly while drilling, or conveyed on wireline or drillpipe after a borehole has been drilled. Formation evaluation is performed to assess the quantity and producibility of fluids from a reservoir. Formation evaluation guides wellsite decisions, such as placement of perforations and hydraulic fracture stages, and reservoir development and production planning.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_evaluation
formation factor,"The ratio of the resistivity of a rock filled with water (Ro) to the resistivity of that water (Rw). G.E. Archie postulated that the formation factor (F) was a constant independent of Rw and solely a function of pore geometry (the Archie equation I). It has since been shown that F is independent of Rw only for a certain class of petrophysically simple rocks (Archie rocks). In rocks with conductive minerals, such as shaly sands, there is a more complex dependence. In such cases, the ratio Ro/Rw is known as the apparent formation factor and may vary with Rw , temperature and the type of ion in solution. The intrinsic formation factor is then defined as F corrected for the effect of shale, or else the value of Ro/Rw at the limit of high salinity (low Rw ). The correction for the effect of shale depends on the saturation equation used, for example Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS or CRMM. Unless otherwise stated, the term formation factor usually refers to the apparent formation factor. F has been related to porosity (phi) by several formulae (Archie, Humble and others) that have the general expression F = a / phim, where a is a constant and m the porosity exponent.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation_factor
fluoroscopy,A technique for imaging a core by moving a core between a source of X-rays and a fluorescent screen. The image on the screen is intensified and recorded by a video camera.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/fluoroscopy
flushed-zone water saturation,"The fraction of water in a given pore space in the flushed zone. It is expressed in volume/volume, percent or saturation units and is given the symbol Sxo. Unless otherwise stated, the pore space concerned is usually the effective porosity. If the pore space concerned is the total porosity, the saturation is more correctly known as the total flushed-zone water saturation; or if it is the effective porosity, the effective flushed-zone water saturation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flushed-zone_water_saturation
flushed zone,"The volume close to the borehole wall in which all of the moveable fluids have been displaced by mud filtrate. The flushed zone contains filtrate and the remaining hydrocarbons, the percentage of the former being the flushed-zone water saturation, Sxo. In simple models, the flushed zone and the invaded zone are synonymous.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flushed_zone
geometrical factor,"The response of a logging measurement as a function of distance from the tool. The geometrical factor can be radial, reflecting the response perpendicular to the tool; vertical, reflecting the response along the tool axis; or two-dimensional, reflecting both. It can also be a differential geometrical factor, which is the contribution to the signal at a particular distance; or integrated, which is the sum of all signals from the tool to a particular distance. The term geometrical factor was introduced for induction logging since it gave a convenient method for computing the reading in a heterogeneous environment. For example, in an invaded formation the log reading, Clog, can be written as: Clog = Gi * Cxo + (1 - Gi) * Ct where Gi is the geometrical factor for a diameter of invasion Di, and Cxo and Ct are the conductivities of the invaded zone and the undisturbed zone. A true geometrical factor depends only on the geometry of the volume concerned, which in practice is only true for induction logs at zero conductivity. However, the term has come to be used for other cases and for other measurements even though the geometrical factor depends significantly on formation properties. The correct term for these cases is the pseudogeometrical factor.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/geometrical_factor
geochemical log,"A log of elemental concentrations from which the geochemistry of the formation may be derived. Several logs provide information on elemental weight concentrations: natural gamma ray spectroscopy, elemental capture spectroscopy or pulsed neutron spectroscopy and aluminum activation. The combination of some or all of their outputs is known as a geochemical log, since it provides information on most of the principal elements found in sedimentary rocks. Pulsed neutron spectroscopy provides relative elemental yields, whereas absolute concentrations are needed for quantitative results. Absolute concentrations can be derived by calibration to core or by using a model such as the oxide-closure model. The absolute elemental concentrations can then be converted into mineral concentrations using a model that defines what minerals are present. The first complete geochemical logs were run in the mid 1980s.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/geochemical_log
gamma-gamma log,"A measurement that uses a source of gamma rays and a detector of gamma rays. The term is synonymous with density log, and is just an older name.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gamma-gamma_log
Gal,"The unit of acceleration commonly used in gravity surveying. 1 Gal (1,000 milliGal or 106 microGal) = 1 cm/s/s.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gal
gravity units,One-tenth of a milliGal: (10 g.u. = 1.0 mGal). Gravity units are sometimes used in old gravity maps.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gravity_units
guard log,A measurement made by a type of electrode device in which the current flow and hence the measurement is focused in a disk that is concentric with and perpendicular to the sonde. The term usually refers to a Laterolog-3 device. Guard logs may be recorded by either wireline or measurements-while-drilling tools.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/guard_log
guard electrode,"An electrode on a laterolog sonde that focuses the current sent by the central current-emitting electrode (A0). The guard electrode is held at the same potential as A0, thereby forcing the current from A0 to run approximately perpendicular to the sonde into the formation, and preventing it from running up the borehole to a great extent.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/guard_electrode
gamma ray log,A common and inexpensive measurement of the natural emission of gamma rays by a formation. Gamma ray logs are particularly helpful because shales and sandstones typically have different gamma ray signatures that can be correlated readily between wells.,Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gamma_ray_log
gamma ray interactions,"Phenomena resulting from the transfer of energy from a gamma ray to matter, usually to an electron. The probability of a specific interaction occurring depends on the atomic number of the material and the energy of the gamma ray. In formation evaluation, there are two types of interactions of interest: the photoelectric effect, which indicates lithology, and Compton scattering, which depends on formation density. The third type of interaction, pair production, occurs at energies above those used for logging.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gamma_ray_interactions
grain density,"The density of a rock or mineral with no porosity, also known as matrix density, commonly in units of g/cm3.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/grain_density
GR,"An abbreviation for gamma ray, usually with reference to the gamma ray log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/g/gr
housing,"The outside steel case of a cartridge or a sonde in a wireline logging tool. The housing isolates the electronics, power supplies and sensors from the borehole and bears the pressure burden.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/housing
horizontal resistivity,"The resistivity of a formation measured by flowing current in a horizontal plane. In anisotropic formations the horizontal and vertical resistivities are different. In a vertical well, wireline induction logs and measurements-while-drilling propagation logs measure the horizontal resistivity, whereas laterologs measure the horizontal resistivity with some component of the vertical. In deviated and horizontal wells, all these logs measure some mixture of both vertical and horizontal resistivity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/horizontal_resistivity
hybrid scale,"An early scale used for the presentation of resistivity logs. The scale has two parts, equally divided about a midpoint. The left part is linear in resistivity, for example 0 on the left edge to 50 ohm-m at the midpoint. The right part is linear in conductivity, from 0 on the right to 1/50 = 20 mS/m at the midpoint. In this way, it was possible to display the complete range of resistivity in one track. It was subsequently replaced by the logarithmic scale.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hybrid_scale
Humble formula,"A particular relation between the formation factor (F) and porosity (phi) proposed by the Humble Oil Company. The original formula was expressed as F = 0.62 / phi2.15. A nearly equivalent form, with a simpler porosity exponent, is F = 0.81 / phi2. These formulae are considered most suitable for relatively high-porosity, sucrosic, or granular, rocks. See Winsauer WO, Shearin HM, Masson PH and Williams M: Resistivity of Brine-Saturated Sands in Relation to Pore Geometry, AAPG Bulletin 36 (1952): 253-277.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/humble_formula
head,"The device that connects the end of the logging cable or the bridle to the top of the logging tool. It contains the weak point, so that when the weak point is broken and the cable removed, the uppermost assembly left in the hole is the head. The top of the head is specially designed to ease fishing of the logging tool, and is also known as the fishing bell.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/head
heading,"The first page or pages on a log print, which include information about the well, the survey, the mud properties and other relevant data.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/heading
head wave,A wave entering a relatively high-velocity medium whose incident and refracted angle is the critical angle.,Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/head_wave
hydrogen index,The number of hydrogen atoms per unit volume divided by the number of hydrogen atoms per unit volume of pure water at surface conditions. The hydrogen index (HI) is thus the density of hydrogen relative to that of water. It is a key factor in the response of a neutron porosity log.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrogen_index
bit resistivity,"The resistivity measured at the drill bit by a measurements-while-drilling (MWD) tool. The bit resistivity measurement responds to resistivity changes as the bit penetrates the formation, or when the time after bit is zero. It is thus an early indication of formation change. The measurement is similar to a wireline electrode device except that toroids are used instead of electrodes. A transmitter toroid induces a low-frequency current in the drillstring, which flows out of the bit and returns farther up the string. The magnitude of the current depends on the resistivity near the bit, and is measured by another toroid. The vertical resolution and depth of investigation depend on the distances between the toroids and the bit, which, in turn, depend on the type of bottomhole assembly (BHA) used. The depth of investigation is sufficient that the effect of the borehole is normally small. The measurement is unfocused and usually not borehole-corrected. Since both bit and drillstring are in physical contact with the formation, it is possible to make the measurement in oil-based muds.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bit_resistivity
Biot theory,"A theory developed by M.A. Biot for acoustic propagation in a porous and elastic medium. Compressional and shear velocities can be calculated by standard elastic theory from the composite density, shear, and bulk modulus of the total rock. The problem is how to determine these from the properties of the constituent parts. Biot showed that the composite properties could be determined from the porosity and the elastic properties (density and moduli) of the fluid, the solid material, and the empty rock skeleton, or framework. To account for different frequencies of propagation, it is also necessary to know the frequency, the permeability of the rock, the viscosity of the fluid, and a coefficient for the inertial drag between skeleton and fluid.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/biot_theory
BHT,"The temperature in the borehole at total depth at the time it is measured. In log interpretation, the bottom hole temperature (BHT) is taken as the maximum recorded temperature during a logging run, or preferably the last of series of runs during the same operation. BHT is the temperature used for the interpretation of logs at total depth. Farther up the hole, the correct temperature is calculated by assuming a certain temperature gradient. The BHT lies between the bottomhole circulating temperature (BHCT) and the bottomhole static temperature (BHST).",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bht
bimetallism,"The electromagnetic force created by two different metals in contact with each other. If two such metals are in contact in a logging tool and also communicate along a conductive borehole, then a potential drop is generated in the borehole. This potential drop will appear on the spontaneous potential (SP) log, where it can be confused with the electrochemical potential. Since the magnitude of the drop depends on the formation resistivity, the effect of bimetallism is often seen as a resistivity log superimposed on the normal SP. Under usual circumstances, the effect of bimetallism on the SP is small, and care is taken to avoid it.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bimetallism
balanced array,"An array induction whose transmitters and receivers are arranged to produce a null reading in free space—that is, which has the mutual signal balanced to zero.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/balanced_array
backup curve,"An extra curve on a log, designed to appear when the standard curve goes off track. For example, if the standard gamma ray curve is presented on a scale of 0 to 200 gAPI, the backup curve may be scaled from 200 to 400 gAPI. Alternatively, if the standard resistivity log is presented on a scale of 0 to 50 ohm.m, the backup curve might be presented on a scale of 0 to 500 ohm.m in the same track but be blanked off for readings below 50 ohm.m. The backup curve usually has the same coding as the standard curve but a different line weight.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/backup_curve
bad hole,"A borehole that is not to gauge or is rugose. The term usually refers to the detrimental effect that such a borehole has on the response of logging measurements, in particular pad tools like the density or microresistivity. The existence of bad hole is usually determined by a caliper log and on various secondary measurements such as delta rho.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bad_hole
broadside array,"A particular arrangement of transmitters and receivers used in the electromagnetic propagation measurement in which the dipoles used as sensors are oriented perpendicular to the axis of the tool. The orientation is combined with relatively short spacings to give a significant signal even in the most attenuative environments, such as salty muds.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/broadside_array
bridle,"A special section of cable that is placed between the logging cable and the head of the logging tool. Unlike the logging cable, the steel load-bearing element is in the center, surrounded by the conductors that are held in an insulating jacket. The bridle is needed for most conventional electrical logs and laterologs in which the cable armor is used as a current return. To be effective, this return must be at some distance from the logging tool and insulated from it. Typical bridles are 80 ft [24 m] long. Electrodes may be wound on the outside of the bridle and connected to the logging tool for use as measurement references or for spontaneous potential measurements.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bridle
base log,The log used as the reference for depths in the well. Each log may record formation features at slightly different depths because of their different response and the difficulty of aligning depths. It is therefore important to select one log to which the other logs are depth matched and that is used as the reference for well-to-well correlation and mechanical operations such as perforating. The gamma ray is most often used as the base log because it can be recorded in both open and cased holes.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/base_log
base exchange,"The quantity of positively charged ions (cations) that a clay mineral or similar material can accommodate on its negatively charged surface, expressed as milli-ion equivalent per 100 g, or more commonly as milliequivalent (meq) per 100 g. Clays are aluminosilicates in which some of the aluminum and silicon ions have been replaced by elements with different valence, or charge. For example, aluminum (Al+++) may be replaced by iron (Fe++) or magnesium (Mg++), leading to a net negative charge. This charge attracts cations when the clay is immersed in an electrolyte such as salty water and causes an electrical double layer. The cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is often expressed in terms of its contribution per unit pore volume, Qv. In formation evaluation, it is the contribution of cation-exchange sites to the formation electrical properties that is important. Various techniques are used to measure CEC in the laboratory, such as wet chemistry, multiple salinity and membrane potential. Wet chemistry methods, such as conductometric titration, usually involve destruction or alteration of the rock. Although quicker and simpler to perform, they are less representative of electrical properties in situ. The multiple salinity and membrane potential methods are more direct measurements of the effect of CEC on formation resistivity and spontaneous potential.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/base_exchange
Boyle's Law Single Cell,"A technique for measuring the pore volume of a core sample by observing the change in pressure of helium introduced into the pore space. The rock sample is held in a core holder whose internal walls are elastomers, so that the only void space is the internal pore volume. With a suitable holder, the sample can be held under a confining stress. Helium is held in a reference cell at known volume and pressure, typically 100 to 200 psi [689 to 1,379 kPa]. The helium is introduced to the core sample, dropping in pressure as it fills the connected pore space. The effective pore volume is obtained from Boyle's Law using the pressure before and after introduction of helium, and the reference volume.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/boyles_law_single_cell
button resistivity,"The resistivity measured by the buttons of a measurements-while-drilling (MWD) toroid device. Typically three buttons, each with a different depth of investigation, are mounted on a sleeve attached to the drillstring, and by their nature are azimuthally focused. The measurement is similar to a wireline microresistivity log, except that toroids are used instead of electrodes for transmitting and monitoring. The button resistivities are focused measurements with vertical resolutions and depths of investigation of a few inches. With three button measurements, it is possible to correct for the presence of invasion, assuming a step profile.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/button_resistivity
butterfly chart,"A plot representing the effect of invasion on resistivity measurements that have different depths of investigation. The plot assumes a step profile model of invasion and determines true resistivity, flushed zone resistivity and diameter of invasion from ratios of deep-, medium- and shallow-resistivity measurements. Strictly speaking, when both resistive and conductive invasion are plotted, the chart is called a butterfly chart. When only one is plotted it is known as a tornado chart.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/butterfly_chart
bucking coil,"A coil in an induction logging tool designed to buck out, or reduce, the direct coupling between transmitter and receiver coils. The direct coupling signal is far larger than the formation signal. The bucking coil is wound with the opposite polarity to the main receiver coil, and placed in series with it at a location that minimizes the direct coupling. The combination of transmitter, main receiver and bucking coils is known as a mutually balanced array.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bucking_coil
bucking current,"On a laterolog device, the current sent through a guard electrode (A1) with the purpose of focusing the current sent by the central current emitting electrode (A0). The bucking current maintains A1 and A0 at the same potential, thereby forcing the current from A0 to run approximately perpendicular to the sonde into the formation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bucking_current
Boyle's Law,"A principle of physics stating that the product of pressure and volume divided by the temperature is a constant for an ideal gas. It is a good approximation for many real gases, such as helium, over reasonable ranges of temperature and pressure.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/boyles_law
buoyancy method,"A technique for measuring the bulk volume of a core sample by submerging it in a bath of mercury and observing the increase in weight of the bath, following Archimedes principle. The bulk volume is calculated from the increase in weight divided by the density of mercury at the temperature of the bath. The sample must not touch the side of the bath and be only a few millimeters below the surface. Mercury is used because it is so strongly nonwetting and therefore does not enter the pore space. Other, less toxic, liquids may be used in the bath, such as brine, refined oil or toluene. In this case, the sample must be fully saturated with the liquid before immersion. In an alternative method, the saturated sample is weighed in air and then again once immersed. The bulk volume is then the difference in weight divided by the density of the liquid used.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/buoyancy_method
bulk relaxation,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, the loss of coherent energy by hydrogen atoms as they interact with each other in bulk fluids. Bulk relaxation in fluids is primarily caused by fluctuating local magnetic fields arising from the random tumbling motion of neighboring molecules. Local field fluctuations may be high, but the fast movement of molecules tends to average these out. Thus, the bulk relaxation depends strongly on the rate of movement and is affected by temperature and viscosity. In water-wet rocks, hydrocarbons do not touch the pore walls and are not affected by surface relaxation. Thus the T1 and T2 of hydrocarbons are the result only of bulk and diffusion relaxation. This is an important feature of NMR logging. Based on this feature, direct hydrocarbon-typing techniques have been developed for the detection and characterization of hydrocarbons.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bulk_relaxation
Boyle's Law Double Cell,"A technique for measuring the grain volume of a core sample by observing the change in pressure of helium introduced into a chamber containing the sample. The rock sample is placed in a chamber of known volume. Helium is held in a reference chamber at known volume and pressure, typically 100 to 200 psi [689 to 1,379 kPa]. The two chambers are connected, causing the helium to drop in pressure as it fills the sample chamber and the pores in the sample. The only volume not filled is the grain volume and the isolated pores. Neglecting the latter, the grain volume can then be calculated from Boyle's Law using the pressure before and after connecting the chambers and the chamber volumes.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/boyles_law_double_cell
bound water,"Water in the pore space that does not flow under normal reservoir conditions. Bound water does not flow on primary or secondary production, injection, or invasion unless the rock wettability is altered. When used in connection with a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, the term refers to all the water that is not free to move. This includes capillary-bound water and clay-bound water. However, water in mineral hydrates is not included as it relaxes too fast to be measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In practice, bound water is defined as the water signal below a certain cutoff, typically 33 ms in sandstones and 100 ms in carbonates. When used in connection with the dual water model, the term refers to the clay-bound water only. In the Hill-Shirley-Klein model, the term is known as the hydration water.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bound_water
bound fluid,"Fluid in the pore space that does not flow under normal reservoir conditions. This fluid may include water, oil, or gas, but most often refers just to bound water. Bound fluid does not flow on primary or secondary production, injection, or invasion unless the rock wettability is altered. When used in connection with a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, the term refers to the signal that occurs below a certain cutoff, typically 33 ms in sandstones and 100 ms in carbonates. The source of this signal is bound water but may also include oil with a viscosity above about 60 cP in sandstones or 30 cP in carbonates. Note that, contrary to the sense of ""bound,"" this oil may or may not be moveable under normal reservoir conditions.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bound_fluid
bottom log interval,"The bottom of the interval recorded on the log, or the deepest point at which the log readings are valid. At the bottom of the well, each log will have a valid first reading at a different depth. The bottom log interval is then either the lowermost first reading or the first reading of the most important log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bottom_log_interval
bound-fluid log,"A type of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) log that is designed to record properly only the bound fluid. Bound fluid is characterized by a fast relaxation time, typically less than 33 ms in sandstones and 100 ms in carbonate rocks. Therefore, the wait time for a bound fluid log can be much shorter than for standard NMR logs, with the result that logging speeds are much faster.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bound-fluid_log
borehole televiewer,"An ultrasonic logging device with a radially mounted rotating transducer that is used to scan the borehole wall. The transducer (in transmit mode) emits a high-frequency pulse that is reflected by the borehole wall back to the transducer (in receive mode). In openhole applications, it can be used to measure the borehole diameter (by measuring the acoustic transit time between transducer and borehole wall) and the amplitude of acoustic signals reflected by the borehole wall. The transducer is rotated to produce a cross section of the borehole size and images of the borehole wall. These are used to identify fractures, breakouts, and other borehole features. In cased hole, they are used to identify internal corrosion.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/borehole_televiewer
bottomhole temperature,"The temperature in the borehole at total depth at the time it is measured. In log interpretation, the bottomhole temperature (BHT) is taken as the maximum recorded temperature during a logging run or preferably the last of series of runs during the same operation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/bottomhole_temperature
Born method,"A method of analyzing the response of an induction logging tool that considers the contribution of each element of the formation as a perturbation from the average background conductivity. The development of the solution is similar to the Born approximation in quantum mechanics, since the latter also involves a single scattering. The Born response is valid for modest formation contrasts. The zero-conductivity Born response is identical to the geometrical factor.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/born_method
borehole correction,"The amount by which a log measurement must be adjusted to remove the contribution of the borehole. Although most log measurements are designed to pick up a minimum of signal from the borehole, some contribution usually remains. This contribution may be removed by software or by manual entry into correction charts. In resistivity logging, the correction replaces the borehole with a resistivity equal to that of the formation. In nuclear logging, the correction adjusts the reading to that which would be found in a standard condition, such as an 8-in [20-cm] borehole filled with fresh water.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/borehole_correction
borehole gravity,"Pertaining to the detection of the Earth's gravitational field within a wellbore. Subtle vertical variations of the Earth's gravity field may be detected over the length of a borehole. These depend on the variations in the formation density not only above and below the sensor, but also laterally away from the borehole. Thus, borehole gravity measurements may be used to detect the following phenomena:",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/borehole_gravity
borehole compensation,"An upgoing and downgoing arrangement of transducers in a logging tool, largely to offset spurious changes in reading caused by variations in borehole size or sonde tilt. The technique is used for measurements that rely on the propagation of a wave, such as sonic, propagation resistivity, and electromagnetic propagation measurement. Propagation logs rely on measuring the difference in properties of a wave at two receivers. The borehole influences this difference if the tool is tilted or if there is a cave opposite one of the receivers. The effect can be compensated for by using two transmitters that radiate sequentially in opposite directions. In ideal conditions, the effect of a tilt or a cave is exactly opposite for the two transmitters, so that an average gives the correct result. Borehole compensation is different from borehole correction.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/borehole_compensation
borehole gravity meter,"A logging instrument capable of making relative gravity measurements at stations along the borehole with a sensitivity and repeatability in the microGal range (about 1 part in 10–9 of the Earth's gravity field) The only commercial measurement device capable of this precision is the LaCoste & Romberg borehole gravimeter, although several research projects have been proposed to replace this classic technology.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/b/borehole_gravity_meter
carbonate gamma ray,"A gamma ray log from which the uranium contribution has been subtracted. In some rocks, and in particular in carbonate rocks, the contribution from uranium can be large and erratic and can cause the carbonate to be mistaken for a shale. The carbonate gamma ray is then a better indicator of shaliness.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/carbonate_gamma_ray
cement bond log,"A representation of the integrity of the cement job, especially whether the cement is adhering solidly to the outside of the casing. The log is typically obtained from one of a variety of sonic-type tools. The newer versions, called cement evaluation logs, along with their processing software, can give detailed, 360° representations of the integrity of the cement job, whereas older versions may display a single line representing the integrated integrity around the casing.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cement_bond_log

capillary pressure curve,"The relationship describing the capillary pressure required to obtain a given nonwetting phase saturation in a rock. Rocks have a distribution of pore throat sizes, so as more pressure is applied to the nonwetting phase, increasingly smaller pore openings are invaded. The capillary pressure curve is important for understanding saturation distribution in the reservoir and affects imbibition and multiphase fluid flow through the rock.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/capillary_pressure_curve
cake,"The residue deposited on a permeable medium when a slurry, such as a drilling fluid, is forced against the medium under a pressure. Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filtercake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filtercake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filtercake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cake

clay-bound water,"Water within the clay lattice or near the surface within the electrical double layer. This water does not move when fluid is flowed through the rock. In the normal definition used by a log analyst, clay-bound water is not part of the effective porosity and is the difference between total porosity and effective porosity. Clay-bound water is understood to include the interlayer water, although the contribution of the latter to the electrical properties of the clay may be different from the water in the electrical double layer. In the dual-water and the Hill-Shirley-Klein models, the volume of clay-bound water is related to the cation-exchange capacity per unit volume, Qv, by expressions that depend on the salinity and temperature of the electrolyte in which the clay is immersed. Direct measurement of the clay-bound water volume in the laboratory is difficult.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/clay-bound_water

cation exchange capacity,"The quantity of positively charged ions (cations) that a clay mineral or similar material can accommodate on its negatively charged surface, expressed as milli-ion equivalent per 100 g, or more commonly as milliequivalent (meq) per 100 g. Clays are aluminosilicates in which some of the aluminum and silicon ions have been replaced by elements with different valence, or charge.

camera,"The device used in early logging to record logging measurements on photographic film. The camera consisted of a light shining on galvanometers, which reflected the light to produce a trace on one or more films. The galvanometers deflected according to the log measurement to give the log reading. The films were turned by the depth wheel, which gave the depth axis of the log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/camera
cave effect,"The effect of a sharp change in the borehole diameter, such as that caused by a cave or rugose hole, on an induction log. In smooth boreholes of constant diameter, the effect of the borehole is well understood and can be corrected for. However, a sharp increase in diameter over a small depth interval can induce signals on one coil in the array and not in others. This signal is not handled by the normal borehole correction and may result in a spike on the log. The spike usually is significant only when the resistivity is high and the contrast between formation and borehole resistivity is very large. The spike also depends on the design of the array or the processing.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cave_effect

corkscrew hole,"The result of certain drilling conditions that cause the borehole to take the shape of a corkscrew. Most logging tools are much longer than the wavelength of the corkscrew, and therefore see it as a change in standoff or a change in hole size. For this reason, the corkscrew is often observed as a wave on the caliper log. A corkscrew hole affects measurements sensitive to standoff, such as induction and neutron porosity, and may affect pad tools, if they cannot follow the changes.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/corkscrew_hole
cementation exponent,"The exponent of porosity, m, in the relation of formation factor, F, to porosity, phi. In the Archie equation, F = 1/ phim, H.

CPMG,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement, referring to the cycle of radio frequency pulses designed by Carr, Purcell, Meiboom and Gill to produce pulse echoes and counteract dephasing due to magnetic field inhomogeneities. In the CPMG sequence, an initial radio frequency pulse is applied long enough to tip the protons into a plane perpendicular to the static magnetic field (the 90o pulse). Initially the protons precess in unison, producing a large signal in the antenna, but then quickly dephase due to the inhomogeneities. Another pulse is applied, long enough to reverse their direction of precession (the 180o pulse), and causing them to come back in phase again after a short time. Being in phase, they produce another strong signal called an echo. They quickly dephase again but can be rephased by another 180o pulse. Rephasing is repeated many times, while measuring the magnitude of each echo. This magnitude decreases with time due to molecular relaxation mechanisms surface, bulk and diffusion. One measurement typically may comprise many hundreds of echoes, while the time between each echo (the echo spacing) is of the order of 1 ms or less.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cpmg
corrected gamma ray,"A gamma ray log from which the uranium contribution has been subtracted. In some rocks, and in particular in carbonate rocks, the contribution from uranium can be large and erratic, and can cause the carbonate to be mistaken for a shale.

core analysis,"Laboratory study of a sample of a geologic formation, usually reservoir rock, taken during or after drilling a well. Economic and efficient oil and gas production is highly dependent on understanding key properties of reservoir rock, such as porosity, permeability, and wettability. Geoscientists have developed a variety of approaches, including log and core analysis techniques, to measure these properties. Core analysis is especially important in shale reservoirs because of the vertical and lateral heterogeneity of the rocks. Core analysis can include evaluation of rock properties and anisotropy; organic matter content, maturity, and type; fluid content; fluid sensitivity; and geomechanical properties. This information can be used to calibrate log and seismic measurements and to help in well and completion design, well placement, and other aspects of reservoir production.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/core_analysis
core gamma log,"A log obtained in the laboratory by moving the core past a gamma ray detector.

Core plugs are ordinarily cut perpendicular to the axis of the core or parallel to the axis, called horizontal and vertical plugs, respectively, when cut from a vertical wellbore. The terms horizontal and vertical are often applied for cores cut from a deviated or horizontal wellbore, even though they are not strictly correct unless core orientation is measured and plugs are cut to the true in-situ orientation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/core_plug
chemical neutron source,An encapsulated radioactive material that emits neutrons for use in neutron porosity measurements. The most common source relies on alpha-beryllium reactions in a 241Am-Be mixture. Beryllium releases a neutron of approximately 4 MeV when struck by an alpha particle. The americium is the source of alpha particles. 253Californium fission is an intense source of 2.3 MeV neutrons but is used only in special applications due to its short half-life of 2.65 years and special licensing requirements.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/chemical_neutron_source
centralizer,"A device fitted with a hinged collar and bowsprings to keep the casing or liner in the center of the wellbore to help ensure efficient placement of a cement sheath around the casing string. If casing strings are cemented off-center, there is a high risk that a channel of drilling fluid or contaminated cement will be left where the casing contacts the formation, creating an imperfect seal.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/centralizer
centrifuge,"An item of solids-removal equipment that removes fine and ultrafine solids. It consists of a conical drum that rotates at 2,000 to 4,000 rpm. Drilling fluid is fed into one end and the separated solids are moved up the bowl by a rotating scroll to exit at the other end. Centrifuges generally have limited processing capacity (50 to 250 galUS/min) but are useful for processing weighted drilling fluids and can remove finer solids than can a hydrocyclone or shaker screens. They can also be used for water clarification or for processing oily cuttings.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/centrifuge
channeling,"The condition in which cement flows in a channel only on some sides of the casing or borehole annulus, and thus does not provide adequate hydraulic isolation in all radial azimuths. The channel frequently manifests itself as an intermediate amplitude signal on a cement bond log. Pulse-echo tools are able to detect a channel because they measure the cement bond at different azimuths.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/channeling
core,"To deepen the wellbore by way of collecting a cylindrical sample of rock. A core bit is used to accomplish this, in conjunction with a core barrel and core catcher. The bit is usually a drag bit fitted with either PDC or natural diamond cutting structures, but the core bit is unusual in that it has a hole in its center. This allows the bit to drill around a central cylinder of rock, which is taken in through the bit and into the core barrel. The core barrel itself may be thought of as a special storage chamber for holding the rock core. The core catcher serves to grip the bottom of the core and, as tension is applied to the drillstring, the rock under the core breaks away from the undrilled formation below it. The core catcher also retains the core so that it does not fall out the bottom of the drillstring, which is open in the middle at that point.",Verb,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/core
core image,"An image of the external or internal features of a core. External images are photographs taken under natural or ultraviolet light; natural light highlights lithology and sedimentary structures, while ultraviolet light causes hydrocarbon zones to fluoresce. Internal images are obtained using X-rays or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). X-ray techniques measure the attenuation of X-rays passing through the core. The attenuation depends mainly on the density. Hence the image reflects density and lithology changes, internal bedding planes, fractures and nodules. These techniques include, in increasing resolution, fluoroscopy, X-radiography and computed tomography. Most NMR images measure the quantity and relaxation time of hydrogen, and therefore give information on fluid distribution. Some NMR techniques examine carbon, sodium and phosphorous.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/core_image
curve,"The presentation on hard copy of log data from a single measurement versus depth. The term is also used to refer to the log data themselves, as a synonym for a single log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/curve
crossplot porosity,"The porosity obtained by plotting two porosity logs against each other, normally density and neutron porosity. The computation assumes a particular fluid, usually fresh water, and particular response equations. The result is largely independent of lithology and is often a more reliable estimate of porosity than a single porosity log. It is often displayed as a quicklook log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/crossplot_porosity
crosswell tomography,"A technique for measuring a signal that is broadcast from a transmitter or source located in one well, to a receiver array placed in a neighboring well. This technique is used to create a display of formation properties such as acoustic velocity and attenuation, seismic reflectivity, or electromagnetic resistivity in the area between wells. The reservoir-scale data acquired with this technique can be used to bridge the gap between wellbore measurements and surface measurements.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/crosswell_tomography
cross dipole,"Describing a waveform or a log that has been recorded by a set of dipole receivers oriented orthogonally (or 90° out of line) with a dipole transmitter. In sonic logging, cross-dipole flexural modes are used to determine shear anisotropy together with in-line flexural modes. The data are processed using the Alford rotation.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cross_dipole
crosswell reflection tomography,A crosswell seismic technique that incorporates reflection traveltimes and direct traveltimes into a tomographic inversion algorithm to produce images of seismic velocity between wells.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/crosswell_reflection_tomography
crosswell electromagnetic tomography,"A technique for measuring formation resistivity between two or more wells. This technique measures the signal between an electromagnetic induction transmitter in one well, and a receiver array located in another well. The transmitting antenna broadcasts a continuous sinusoidal signal at programmable frequencies. Tomographic processing creates a map of resistivity of the area between the wells. Measurements acquired by this technique have a greater depth of investigation than conventional logging tools and are sensitive to fluid content. Crosswell electromagnetic induction surveys fill an intermediate role between high-resolution well logs and lower-resolution surface measurements. Asset managers utilize crosswell electromagnetic surveys for a variety of applications, such as monitoring sweep efficiency, identifying bypassed pay, planning infill drilling locations and improving the effectiveness of reservoir simulations.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/crosswell_electromagnetic_tomography
crosswell seismic tomography,"A survey technique that measures the seismic signal transmitted from a source, located in one well, to a receiver array in a neighboring well. The resulting data are processed to create a reflection image or to map the acoustic velocity or other properties (velocities of P- and S-waves, for example) of the area between wells. Placement of the source and receiver array in adjacent wells not only enables the formation between wells to be surveyed, it also avoids seismic signal propagation through attenuative near-surface formations. Another advantage is that it places the source and receiver near the reservoir zone of interest, thereby obtaining better resolution than is possible with conventional surface seismic surveys. This technique is often used for high-resolution reservoir characterization when surface seismic or vertical seismic profile (VSP) data lack resolution, or for time-lapse monitoring of fluid movements in the reservoir.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/crosswell_seismic_tomography
cross section,"A diagram of a vertical section through a volume, as opposed to the surface, ""bird's eye,"" or plan view of a map. Cross sections are useful for displaying the types and orientations of subsurface structures and formations.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cross_section
coding,"The characteristics of the trace used to display a log. The most common codings are solid, long-dashed, short-dashed and dotted. The trace can also have a different line weight or thickness, from light to heavy.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/coding
conductive invasion,"A situation in which the resistivity of the flushed zone is less than the resistivity of the undisturbed zone. Such a setting generally favors the use of electrode resistivity devices (laterologs, ring resistivity), which respond to resistivity, rather than induction and propagation resistivity devices, which respond to conductivity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/conductive_invasion
conductive rock matrix model,"A model, or set of equations, for the resistivity response of formations with conductive minerals, such as shaly sands. The model is used to analyze core data and to calculate water saturation from resistivity and other logs. The conductive rock matrix model (CRMM) was proposed by W. Givens. The model treats the rock as two components in parallel: a conductive pore network with fluid that is free to move, and the remainder of the rock, which may have conductive minerals or immobile but conductive water. The model is not concerned with the origin of this conductivity, but gives it a resistivity, Rm. The two components are in parallel as follows: 1 / Rt = 1 / Rp + 1 / Rm where Rp is the resistance of the free-fluid pore network and can be expressed in terms of the porosity and formation water resistivity by the Archie equation. The model was developed from core data, and can explain the observed variations of the porosity exponent with porosity and the saturation exponent with water saturation in shaly sands. For log analysis Rm needs to be related to parameters that can be measured by logs.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/conductive_rock_matrix_model
conductivity,"The ability of a material to conduct electricity. It is the inverse of resistivity and is measured in siemens per meter (S/m) or mho/m. The conductivity is a property of the material, whereas the conductance also depends on the volume measured. The two are related by a system constant, which in simple cases is the length between the measurement electrodes divided by the area. In the most general case, the conductivity is the current density divided by the electric field and depends on the frequency of the applied signal.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/conductivity
conductometric titration,"A technique for estimating the cation-exchange capacity of a sample by measuring the conductivity of the sample during titration. The technique includes crushing a core sample and mixing it for some time in a solution like barium acetate, during which all the cation-exchange sites are replaced by barium (Ba++) ions. The solution is then titrated with another solution, such as MgSO4, while observing the change in conductivity as the magnesium (Mg++) ions replace the Ba++ ions. For several reasons, but mainly because the sample must be crushed, the measured cation-exchange capacity may differ from that which affects the in situ electrical properties of the rock.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/conductometric_titration
compensated neutron log,"A neutron porosity log in which the effects of the borehole environment are minimized by using two detectors. In the most common technique, the two source-detector spacings are chosen so that the ratio of the two count rates is relatively independent of the borehole environment. This ratio is then calibrated in terms of porosity in a known formation and borehole environment typically with the tool placed against the side of an 8-in. [20-cm] borehole in a limestone block, both filled with fresh water at surface temperature and pressure. The response is also determined at different porosities and in sandstones, dolomites and other borehole environments. Correction factors are developed to convert the measured log to the standard conditions. The source and detectors are not azimuthally focused. Wireline tools are run eccentralized against the borehole wall. Since the neutrons emitted into the mud are strongly attenuated, the resulting log is effectively focused into the formation. Measurements-while-drilling tools will normally be unfocused since they are centralized unless the borehole is overgauge. The vertical resolution is about 2 ft [0.6 m], but can be improved by alpha processing.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/compensated_neutron_log
compatible scales,"Scales for different logs that are chosen so that the logs will overlay in certain conditions. For example, a sandstone-compatible scale may have the neutron log scaled from 0.45 to -0.15 vol/vol and the density from 1.9 to 2.9 g/cm3. Then, in a pure quartz sandstone filled with fresh water, the two logs will overlay as the porosity varies.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/compatible_scales
composite log,"A single log created by splicing together two logs of the same type run at different times in the well; or by splicing two different types of log run at the same time. For example, it is common practice to splice all the basic logs run over different depth intervals in a well to obtain a single composite record.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/composite_log
cable,"A bundle of electrical wires that connects geophones, or the entire carrier system for marine hydrophones, which includes the hydrophones, the electrical wires, the stress member, spacers, the outer skin of the cable, and the streamer filler, which is typically kerosene or a buoyant plastic. The cable relays data to the seismic recording truck or seismic vessel.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/cable
compressibility,The ratio of the percent change in volume to the change in pressure applied to a fluid or rock.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/compressibility
computed tomography,A technique for imaging a core by scanning it with a highly focused source of X-rays and recording the attenuated X-rays on the other side. The source and detector are rotated and moved along the core. The measurements are combined mathematically to give a full core image.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/computed_tomography
Compton scattering,"A gamma ray interaction in which the gamma ray collides with an electron, transferring part of its energy to the electron, while itself being scattered at a reduced energy. Compton scattering occurs with high probability at intermediate gamma ray energies, between 75 keV and 10 MeV in sedimentary formations. When a beam of gamma rays traverses a material, the total reduction due to Compton scattering depends on the electron density of the material the higher the density, the larger the reduction. This is the basis for the density log. Compton scattering is also an important mechanism in gamma ray detectors.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/compton_scattering
compensated density log,"A density log that has been corrected for the effect of mud and mudcake by using two or more detectors at different spacings from the source. The shorter the spacing, the shallower the depth of investigation and the larger the effect of the mudcake. Thus, a short spaced detector, which is very sensitive to the mudcake, can be used to correct a long-spaced detector, which is only slightly sensitive to it. In a typical two-detector compensation scheme, the density measured by the longest spacing detector is corrected by an amount, delta rho, which is a function of the difference between long- and short-spacing densities. The correction is found to depend on the difference between formation and mudcake density multiplied by mudcake thickness. Although there are three unknowns, simple functions are reliable for moderate corrections. Experimental results are often presented in the form of a spine and ribs plot. There are other schemes using, for example, more detectors. Dual detector density logs were introduced in the mid 1960s.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/compensated_density_log
dielectric constant,"The degree to which a medium resists the flow of electric charge, defined as the ratio of the electric displacement to the electric field strength. It is more common to use the relative dielectric constant.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dielectric_constant
depth wheel,"A calibrated wheel used to drive the depth recording system in wireline logging. The wheel is pressed against the logging cable as the cable is spooled onto the drum and therefore turns as the cable is run in and out of the borehole. After zeroing the depth on surface, the depth wheel provides the depth input to the recording system. Small errors in calibration and slippage can cause the wheel to introduce systematic errors in the depth recorded. For this reason, the depth is checked and corrected using depth marks. The depth wheel is also referred to as a depth encoder. Modern encoders have two wheels so that slippage can be detected by differences between the two measurements.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depth_wheel
diffusion,The movement of ions or molecules from regions of high concentration to low concentration within a solution.,Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diffusion
diffusion relaxation,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement, the loss of coherent energy by hydrogen atoms as they move within the pore space. Hydrogen atoms that move significantly within the pores during a NMR measurement will encounter different magnetic fields and hence will precess at different rates, or dephase. Dephasing contributes only to T2 and is most significant in gas or light oils. The magnitude depends on the field gradient, the echo spacing and the diffusion coefficient of the fluid. Diffusion relaxation can be induced in water by using long echo spacings. This is the basis of the enhanced diffusion technique.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diffusion_relaxation
dielectric permittivity,"The degree to which a medium resists the flow of electric charge, defined as the ratio of the electric displacement to the electric field strength. It is more common to use the relative dielectric permittivity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dielectric_permittivity
dip correction,"An algorithm for correcting the effects of dip or borehole deviation on the response of a logging measurement. These effects are significant for deep-reading logs such as induction and electrode devices. The standard processing used to produce these logs assumes a vertical well with horizontal formation layers. In the presence of a relative dip between the borehole and formation layers, the logs may read incorrectly. For older logs such as the dual induction, a set of inverse filters can be designed to correct for dip effect up to about 60. For modern array logs, iterative forward modeling with a one-dimensional layered earth model can correct up to about 85.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dip_correction
dielectric propagation log,"A log of the high-frequency (on the order of 25 MHz) dielectric properties of the formation. The log usually includes two curves the relative dielectric permittivity, symbolized by epsilon which is unitless, and the resistivity in ohm-m. At the frequency used, water molecules have a strong effect on the dielectric properties, so that both relative dielectric permittivity and conductivity increase with the volume of water present. Relative dielectric permittivity can be used to distinguish hydrocarbons from water of any salinity. However, the effect of salinity is more important than the salinity effect with the high-frequency electromagnetic propagation log, and the interpretation is more complex. The advantage of the dielectric propagation log is that the lower frequency permits a larger depth of investigation and therefore an analysis of the undisturbed zone.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dielectric_propagation_log
differential spectrum,"A technique in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging that is based on the difference between the T2 distributions, or spectra, acquired at different polarization times. The technique often is used to detect gas or light oil. These fluids have long T1 that exceed 1 second. A measurement made with a long polarization time will polarize much of these fluids and give significant signal at the appropriate T2. A measurement made with a short polarization time will polarize little of these fluids and will give a much smaller signal. Other fluids, with shorter T1, will be polarized in both cases, so that a difference in signal at the appropriate T2 identifies gas or light oil.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/differential_spectrum
deep induction,"A particular type of induction log that was designed to read deep into the formation while maintaining reasonable vertical resolution. The deep induction log (ID) is based on the measurement of a 6FF40 array and was combined with a medium induction array to form the dual induction tool. Versions built after 1968 had a small extra transmitter coil to reduce the borehole effect on the medium induction while changing the deep response very little. The midpoint of the ID integrated radial geometrical factor is at 62 in [157 cm] radius for high resistivities, reducing to 45 in [114 cm] at 1 ohm-m. ID receives very little signal from within 20 in [50 cm] of the tool. The vertical resolution is about 8 ft [2.4 m] but varies with local conditions.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/deep_induction
depth-derived,"Referring to a borehole-compensation scheme for sonic logs that combines measurements taken when the logging tool is at two different depths in the borehole. In normal borehole-compensation schemes, the effects of caves and sonde tilt are minimized by combining measurements from a second transmitter (T2) above a pair of receivers with those from the first transmitter (T1) below the receivers. This arrangement makes the logging tool unacceptably long for the long-spacing sonic log. In the depth-derived system, T2 is located below T1, at a distance equal to the receiver spacing. T1 is fired and the transit time between the receivers at depth z (TT1z) is recorded as usual. Then when T1 and T2 are at depth z, both are fired sequentially and the difference in time for their signals to reach one of the receivers is recorded (TT2z). The average of TT1z and TT2z is borehole-compensated since the acoustic signals traveled in opposite directions for the two measurements.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depth-derived
deconvolution,"A step in seismic signal processing to recover high frequencies, attenuate multiples, equalize amplitudes, produce a zero-phase wavelet or for other purposes that generally affect the waveshape. Deconvolution, or inverse filtering, can improve seismic data that were adversely affected by filtering, or convolution that occurs naturally as seismic energy is filtered by the Earth. Deconvolution can also be performed on other types of data, such as gravity, magnetic or well log data.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/deconvolution
data rate,"The rate at which measurements are transmitted between logging tool and surface. In measurement while drilling (MWD), if the data rate is low in comparison with the drilling or tripping speed, the sampling interval or the amount of data transmitted must be reduced or else information will be lost. In wireline logging, the data rate can limit the logging speed or the number of tools in the tool string.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/data_rate
Dean-Stark extraction,"A method for the measurement of fluid saturations in a core sample by distillation extraction. The water in the sample is vaporized by boiling solvent, then condensed and collected in a calibrated trap. This gives the volume of water in the sample. The solvent is also condensed, then flows back over the sample and extracts the oil. Extraction continues for a minimum of two days until the extracted solvent is clean or the sample shows no more fluorescence. The weight of the sample is measured before and after extraction. Then the volume of oil is calculated from the loss in weight of the sample minus the weight of the water removed from it. Saturations are calculated from the volumes.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dean-stark_extraction
depth matched,"Pertaining to two or more logging curves that have been aligned in depth. Logs recorded on different runs will not be exactly aligned at all depths because of the difficulty of perfect depth control. If the two logs are offset by the same amount throughout the log, then only a simple depth shift is required. If the offset varies, then the logs need to be depth matched. Depth matching is simplest if both runs contain the same type of log, such as a gamma ray. The two gamma rays can then be aligned, either manually or with software, and the other logs shifted by the same amount. Otherwise the alignment is based on two logs that respond in a similar fashion, such as a neutron porosity and a shallow laterolog. Depth matching also may be needed for logs recorded on the same run. Although there is a fixed distance between the measure points and the depth reference, the apparent distance will vary if the tool moves unevenly up the hole, due to stick and slip or yo-yo effects. Depth matching is then necessary.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depth_matched
dielectric resistivity,"The resistivity of the formation derived by combining the attenuation and phase shift of a propagation resistivity measurement. Common practice is to transform attenuation and phase shift independently to resistivity, assuming a certain transform between permittivity and resistivity. These relations lose accuracy at high resistivity. However, by combining the two measurements, both the dielectric permittivity and resistivity can be determined without need for a transform. The dielectric resistivity extends the range of measurement, typically up to 3000 ohm-m.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dielectric_resistivity
differential SP,"The spontaneous potential (SP) measured between two electrodes placed close together in the borehole, as opposed to the normal SP, which is measured with one electrode in the borehole and one at surface.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/differential_sp
depth correlation,The process of comparing and fixing measured depths with known features on baseline logs of the wellbore tubulars and the surrounding formation.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depth_correlation
depth datum,"Also known as depth reference, the point in a well from which depth is measured. Alternatively, the depth reference is the point at which the depth is defined as being zero. It is typically the top of the kelly bushing or the level of the drill floor on the rig that is used to drill the well. The depth measured from that point is the measured depth (MD) for the well. Even when the drilling rig has been removed, all subsequent measurements and operations in the well are still tied in to the same depth reference. However, for multiwell studies, the depths are normally shifted to the permanent datum. The depth reference and its elevation above the permanent datum are recorded on the log heading. In some contexts, the term may refer to any point from which depth is measured.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depth_datum
depth mark,"A magnetic mark placed on a logging cable as a reference for depth measurements. The marks are placed on the cable at regular intervals, usually 100 ft [30 m] or 50 m [164 ft], under a certain tension in a workshop. The intervals may change slightly as a function of tension downhole, but this change can be corrected for. During logging operations, the marks are detected by a magnetic mark detector, and then used to check and correct the depth read by the depth wheel.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depth_mark
depth of invasion,"The distance from the borehole wall that the mud filtrate has penetrated into the formation. The depth of invasion affects whether a log measures the invaded zone, the undisturbed zone or part of each zone. The term is closely related to the diameter of invasion, the latter being twice the depth of invasion plus the borehole diameter. Depth of invasion is a more appropriate parameter for describing the response of pad and azimuthally focused measurements such as density and microresistivity logs. The term is well-defined in the case of a step profile of invasion. In the case of an annulus or a transition zone, two depths must be defined, corresponding to the inner and outer limits of the annulus or transition zone. When the invasion model is not specified, the term usually refers to the outer limit of invasion.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depth_of_invasion
depth of investigation,"A distance that characterizes how far a logging tool measures into the formation from the face of the tool or the borehole wall. The depth of investigation summarizes the radial response of the measurement in one or more directions. For nuclear and resistivity measurements, the depth of investigation should be associated with the percentage of signal received from within that depth, typically either 50% or 90%. Most quoted depths of investigation assume a homogeneous formation with certain properties, such as a given resistivity or fluid content. The depths of investigation can vary considerably in inhomogeneous conditions, and at different values of the properties concerned. They should be considered only a qualitative guide to tool response. For other measurements, the depth of investigation is either well-defined by the tool physics (in the case of nuclear magnetic resonance), or else can be given only approximately, an accurate value being too dependent on formation properties (in the case of acoustic and electromagnetic propagation). The term is used for all measurements but is most appropriate for azimuthally focused devices such as nuclear logs. For azimuthally symmetric devices such as resistivity logs, the term radius of investigation is more appropriate.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depth_of_investigation
depth reference,"The point in a well from which depth is measured. Alternatively, the depth reference is the point at which the depth is defined as being zero. It is typically the top of the kelly bushing or the level of the drill floor on the rig that is used to drill the well. The depth measured from that point is the measured depth (MD) for the well. Even when the drilling rig has been removed, all subsequent measurements and operations in the well are still tied in to the same depth reference. However, for multiwell studies, the depths are normally shifted to the permanent datum. The depth reference and its elevation above the permanent datum are recorded on the log heading. In some contexts, the term may refer to any point from which depth is measured.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/depth_reference
delta t stretch,"A feature on a sonic log caused by low signal amplitude that results in erroneously long traveltimes. Sonic logs that do not record waveforms measure the acoustic traveltime between transmitter and receiver by detecting the first signal at the receiver above a certain threshold (first motion detection). The threshold is small so that the signal is detected just after it crosses the zero signal baseline. However, if the threshold is set too high, or the signal is too small, the system will not trigger at the sharp zero crossing but at some later point on the waveform. This increases the apparent transmitter-receiver time. Delta-t stretch is more likely at the far receiver, where signals are weaker, so that the apparent traveltime calculated between receivers is too large. In the extreme case, the system triggers on the next cycle of the waveform, known as cycle skipping.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/delta_t_stretch
delta rho,"A log that shows the magnitude of the correction applied to the long spacing detector of a density measurement. When delta rho is above a certain value, typically ±0.15 g/cm3, the correction may no longer be accurate, and needs to be examined in more detail. Delta rho is also used as a qualitative indicator of borehole rugosity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/delta_rho
delta t,"Also called interval transit time, the amount of time for a wave to travel a certain distance, proportional to the reciprocal of velocity, typically measured in microseconds per foot by an acoustic log and symbolized by t or DT. P-wave interval transit times for common sedimentary rock types range from 43 (dolostone) to 160 (unconsolidated shales) microseconds per foot, and can be distinguished from measurements of steel casing, which has a consistent transit time of 57 microseconds per foot.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/delta_t
density measurement,"A measurement of the bulk density of the formation, based on the reduction in gamma ray flux between a source and a detector due to Compton scattering. The gamma ray source, usually 137Cs (cesium), is chosen so that gamma ray energies are high enough to interact by Compton scattering but not by pair production. The detectors discriminate against low gamma ray energies that may have been influenced by photoelectric absorption. Although Compton scattering depends on electron density and not bulk density, density logs are calibrated to give the correct bulk density in the majority of sedimentary rocks. Due to the Z/A effect there are small differences in some formations. The measurement responds to the average density of the material between source and detector. In the wireline measurement, care is taken to minimize the mud between the sensors and the formation by pressing a pad against the borehole wall, with source and detector focused into the formation. In the logging-while-drilling measurement, a sleeve may be mounted on the collar around the sensors to exclude the mud. The detectors measure the gamma rays scattered from the formation. Even then, mudcake or borehole rugosity can affect the measurement. It is common practice to compensate for the mudcake by using two or more detectors at different spacings.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/density_measurement
departure curve,"A graph that shows the effects of environmental factors on the ideal response of a measurement. The name comes from the departure of the actual response from the ideal. The term is used most commonly in relation to the effect of hole size, mud resistivity, bed thickness, invasion and other factors on electrical logs.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/departure_curve
dephasing,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement, the loss of synchronization of hydrogen atoms precessing at different speeds about the static magnetic field. When the signals from individual atoms are not synchronized, they are out of phase and the total signal is reduced. The dephasing occurs either because of inhomogeneities in the static magnetic field or through molecular processes. Dephasing due to inhomogeneities is known as the free-induction decay and is corrected by the CPMG sequence. Molecular dephasing is known as transverse relaxation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dephasing
diameter of invasion,"The distance from the borehole wall into the formation that the mud filtrate has penetrated. The term assumes equal invasion on all sides of the borehole. It is the diameter of the circle thus formed, with the center being the center of the borehole. The diameter of invasion affects whether a log measures the invaded zone, the undisturbed zone, or part of each zone. The term is closely related to the depth of invasion, being twice the depth of invasion plus the borehole diameter. Diameter of invasion is a more appropriate parameter for describing the response of azimuthally symmetric measurements such as induction, laterolog and propagation resistivity. The term is well-defined in the case of a step profile of invasion. In the case of an annulus or a transition zone, two diameters must be defined, corresponding to the inner and outer limits of the annulus or transition zone. When the invasion model is not specified, the term usually refers to the outer limit of invasion.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/diameter_of_invasion
diameter of investigation,A distance that characterizes how far a logging tool measures into the formation from the axis of the tool or borehole.

dual induction,"The combination of a deep-induction and a medium-induction array on the same sonde. In a typical implementation, the two arrays share the same transmitters but have different receivers. If the dual-induction log is combined with a shallow laterolog or microresistivity log, it is possible to correct for the effect on invasion on the deep log, assuming a step profile.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dual_induction

distillation extraction,"A technique for cleaning core samples in which the water fraction is removed by distillation and the oil fraction is extracted using solvents. Cleaning is done with either the Soxhlet or, when fluid saturation measurements are required, the Dean-Stark apparatus. Different solvents are used depending on the type of fluids and rock, the most common ones being toluene, methanol, xylene, and chloroform. Several solvents may be used in sequence.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/distillation_extraction
direct hydrocarbon typing,"The application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging to the determination of hydrocarbon type (gas, light oil, medium oil, heavy oil), using only NMR data. Three techniques are most commonly used: differential spectrum, shifted spectrum, and enhanced diffusion.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/direct_hydrocarbon_typing
drainage,"The process of forcing a nonwetting phase into a porous rock. Oil migrates into most reservoirs as the non-wetting phase, so initial charging of the reservoir is a drainage process.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/drainage
relative dielectric permittivity,"The degree to which a medium resists the flow of electric charge divided by the degree to which free space resists such charge. The degree, or dielectric permittivity, is defined as the ratio of the electric displacement to the electric field strength. The term is also known as the relative dielectric constant. However, at high frequencies, it is no longer constant and decreases with frequency. Relative dielectric permittivities, which are unitless, vary from about 4 to 400 in rock, but in rare cases may reach several thousand.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/relative_dielectric_permittivity
reproducibility,"The closeness of agreement between individual results obtained in the normal and correct operation of the same method on identical test material, but under different test conditions (such as different operators, different apparatus, different laboratories). (ISO) The reproducibility of core and log measurements can be checked properly in the laboratory. However, it is difficult to check the reproducibility of downhole log measurements because of the problem of ensuring that the same test material is used, in other words that the same volume of formation is measured each time, or that the formation fluids have not changed.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reproducibility
remaining oil saturation,"Fraction of pore volume occupied by oil at any location in a reservoir at any time during its life. Remaining oil saturation has no petrophysical significance beyond an assessment of the amount of oil remaining in the rock. Considered a snapshot of the reservoir, this assessment depends on the location in the reservoir and time of the measurement. This saturation is measured without regard to the displacement process or processes that produced it.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/remaining_oil_saturation
relaxation time,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement, the characteristic time for a loss of coherent energy, or relaxation, by protons in rocks. There are two types of relaxation: longitudinal relaxation, which is the time (T1) needed to align protons in a static magnetic field; and transverse relaxation, which is the time (T2) needed for protons to lose their coherent energy in an NMR measurement. Relaxations are exponential decays, for which T1 and T2 are the time constants. Different mechanisms contribute to T1 and T2. Surface relaxation and bulk relaxation contribute to both T1 and T2. Surface, bulk and diffusion relaxation contribute to T2.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/relaxation_time
radial resolution,"A distance that characterizes the ability of a logging measurement to resolve changes in the formation perpendicular to the tool. Alternatively, the term refers to the smallest distance for which a significant change can be detected. The resolution is a feature of the radial response, which is often summarized by a geometrical or pseudogeometrical factor. A measurement with good or high radial resolution will have a sharp peak in the radial differential geometric factor at some distance from the tool.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/radial_resolution
radial response,"The response of a logging measurement as a function of the distance perpendicular to the tool. Radial responses are determined by computer simulation or laboratory measurement. For some measurements, mainly resistivity, the radial response can be shaped as desired through signal processing. In general, the radial response depends on the formation properties throughout the measurement volume. Most quoted radial responses have been determined in formations that are vertically homogeneous and have small radial changes. They can then be summarized by a geometrical factor or a pseudogeometrical factor. These factors are appropriate for volumetric measurements such as nuclear and resistivity measurements, but not for others such as acoustic propagation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/radial_response
rugosity,"A qualitative description of the roughness of a borehole wall. Alternatively, the term pertains to a borehole whose diameter changes rapidly with depth. The term usually refers to changes at the scale of logging measurements, a few inches to a few feet, and to the effect this has on logging tool responses. Rugosity can be observed on caliper logs, image logs and by its effect on measurements with a small depth of investigation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/rugosity
recorder,"Also called camera, the device used in early logging to record logging measurements on photographic film. The camera consisted of a light shining on galvanometers, which reflected the light to produce a trace on one or more films. The galvanometers deflected according to the log measurement to give the log reading. The films were turned by the depth wheel, which gave the depth axis of the log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/recorder

Rwa,"The apparent resistivity of the formation water, calculated from log measurements of porosity (phi) and resistivity (Rt) and using the Archie equation with Sw = 1, so that Rwa = phim * Rt. Rwa is a quick-look method of determining if there are hydrocarbons. In a hydrocarbon zone, Rwa will be higher than the actual resistivity of the formation water (Rw), which must be known. A typical rule of thumb is that if Rwa > 3 * Rw, then there are producible hydrocarbons. Rwa is often calculated and output as a quicklook log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/rwa
ring resistivity,"The resistivity measured by the ring of a measurements-while-drilling (MWD) toroid device. The ring resistivity is a focused measurement with a depth of investigation and a vertical resolution of a few inches. It is not azimuthal. The measurement is similar to a wireline laterolog except that toroids are used instead of electrodes for transmitting and monitoring. Like a laterolog, the signal is proportional to resistivity, and is thus most effective at high resistivities, high formation to mud-resistivity contrast and in the presence of conductive invasion. It is usually combined with the bit resistivity, and possibly also with the button resistivities. In the same way as a laterolog, two transmitter toroids are used to force current to flow approximately perpendicularly into the formation at the ring. Other toroids measure the current flow and to balance the currents emitted by the two transmitters.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/ring_resistivity

Recommended practices for routine core analysis are available in the API document RP40.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/routine_core_analysis
ROS,"Abbreviation for remaining oil saturation. Fraction of pore volume occupied by oil at any location in a reservoir at any time during its life. Remaining oil saturation has no petrophysical significance beyond an assessment of the amount of oil remaining in the rock. Considered a snapshot of the reservoir, this assessment depends on the location in the reservoir and time of the measurement. This saturation is measured without regard to the displacement process or processes that produced it.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/ros
random error,"A nonreproducible error that is generally imputable to the physics of the measurement. For example, the statistical errors in nuclear measurements are random errors.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/random_error
radius of investigation,"A distance that characterizes how far a logging tool measures into the formation from the axis of the tool or borehole. The term is similar to depth of investigation, but is more appropriate for certain azimuthally symmetric measurements, mainly resistivity. The radius of investigation summarizes the radial response of the measurement in one or more distances, and should be associated with the percentage of signal received from within that depth, typically either 50% or 90%. Most quoted depths of investigation assume a homogeneous formation with certain properties, such as a given resistivity or fluid content. The radius of investigation can vary considerably in inhomogeneous conditions, and at different values of the properties concerned. It should be considered only a qualitative guide to tool response.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/radius_of_investigation
real-time data,"With reference to measurements-while-drilling (MWD), the data transmitted to surface shortly after being recorded. These are distinct from the recorded data. Only a subset of the recorded data can be transmitted as real-time data because of the limited data rate of MWD telemetry systems. This reduces the number of channels, the sample interval, or both, in the real-time data.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/real-time_data
radial processing,"The inversion of resistivity logs with differing depths of investigation into a model of the formation invasion profile.

response matched,"Relating to two or more logging measurements that have the same response. The term normally refers to vertical resolution, but could also be used for azimuthal or radial resolution. The term implies that all the features of the vertical response are matched, ideally in all conditions. In practice, it is used to describe a more detailed matching of the vertical response than with resolution-matched curves.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/response_matched
resistivity index,"The ratio of the true resistivity to the resistivity of the same rock filled with water. The resistivity index can be expressed as I = Rt / Ro, where Ro is the water filled resistivity and Rt is the true resistivity.

resistivity log,"A log of the resistivity of the formation, expressed in ohm-m. The resistivity can take a wide range of values, and, therefore, for convenience is usually presented on a logarithmic scale from, for example, 0.2 to 2000 ohm-m. The resistivity log is fundamental in formation evaluation because hydrocarbons do not conduct electricity while all formation waters do. Therefore a large difference exists between the resistivity of rocks filled with hydrocarbons and those filled with formation water. Clay minerals and a few other minerals, such as pyrite, also conduct electricity, and reduce the difference. Some measurement devices, such as induction and propagation resistivity logs, may respond more directly to conductivity, but are presented in resistivity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/resistivity_log
resistivity,"The ability of a material to resist electrical conduction. It is the inverse of conductivity and is measured in ohm-m. The resistivity is a property of the material, whereas the resistance also depends on the volume measured. The two are related by a system constant, which in simple cases is the length between the measurement electrodes divided by the area. In the general case, the resistivity is the electric field divided by the current density and depends on the frequency of the applied signal.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/resistivity
resistive invasion,"A situation in which the resistivity of the flushed zone is greater than the resistivity of the undisturbed zone.

residual oil saturation,"Fraction of pore volume occupied by oil at the end of oil displacement that used a specific fluid. This reservoir engineering quantity signifies the ultimate recovery under a given displacement process and represents the endpoint of the relative permeability curves in reservoir simulation. The residual oil saturation quantity is the saturation achieved after an infinite number of pore volumes of the displacing fluid have flowed through a particular portion of reservoir rock. To define residual oil saturation, the displacement method and the type, volume, direction and velocity of the displacing fluid must be known. Residual oil saturation is the ratio of the immobile residual oil volume divided by the effective porosity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/residual_oil_saturation
Rh,Abbreviation for horizontal resistivity.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/rh
retort method,"A technique for measuring the fluid saturations in a core sample by heating the sample and measuring the volumes of water and oil driven off. The sample is crushed and weighed before being placed in the retort. It is then heated in stages or directly to 650oC [1200oF] during which the fluids are vaporized, collected, condensed and separated. Plateaus in the rise of the cumulative water volume with temperature are sometimes analyzed to indicate when free water, surface clay-bound water and interlayer clay-bound water have been driven off. The volumes of water and oil are measured directly, but corrections are needed to account for alterations in the oil. The volume of gas also is needed for accurate results. This is measured on a separate, adjacent sample by injecting mercury under pressure and measuring the volume absorbed. Before injection, the sample is weighed and its bulk volume determined by mercury displacement. The total pore volume is then the sum of the volumes of gas, oil and water. The saturation of each component is the ratio of its volume to the total pore volume.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/retort_method

R signal,"The resistive (R) signal, or that part of the alternating signal at the receiver of an induction-logging tool that is in phase with the transmitter current. This signal depends on the formation conductivity and is the main or, in older tools, the only source of the induction log. It must be separated from the out-of-phase, or reactive (X) signal, which depends in a different way on formation conductivity and may contain a large component from direct coupling between transmitter and receiver.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/r_signal
repeatability,"The closeness of agreement between independent results obtained in the normal and correct operation of the same method on identical test material, in a short space of time, and under the same test conditions (such as the same operator, same apparatus, same laboratory). (ISO) The repeatability of core and log measurements can be checked properly in the laboratory. The repeatability of a downhole log is checked by recording a repeat section (or repeat stations for stationary measurements). The term repeatability is used even though it is not possible to ensure that the same test material is used. On two separate runs, the tool may not take the same path in the borehole, and therefore may not measure the same volume of formation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/repeatability
reference point,"The position on a logging tool string that is used as the reference for depth measurements. Each measurement has a different measure point. In normal practice, each measurement is shifted in depth by the distance between the measure point and the reference point. This ensures that all measurements are recorded at the same depth. For a wireline tool, the reference point is normally the bottom of the tool string. For measurements-while-drilling, the reference is the bit (the driller's depth). The term is sometimes used to mean the depth reference.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/reference_point
reservoir quality (RQ),"A prediction of the likelihood of a rock to yield commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Reservoir quality (RQ) is a geologic, engineering and economic assessment of a resource, its reserves and their producibility.

repeat section,"An interval of log that has been recorded for a second time. The repeat section is typically 200 ft [60 m] long. The purpose is to judge the repeatability of the measurement by recording it twice over the same interval with the same recording parameters. Strictly speaking, the repeatability can be judged properly only if the depth measurement is the same on both runs, if the tool takes the same path in the borehole and if there have been no changes in the borehole or formation. In practice, the repeat section gives a good overall picture of the repeatability of the log. There can be more than one repeat section.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/repeat_section

lateral,"Referring to a type of conventional electrical log in which the current-emitting and the current-return electrodes (A and B) are placed close together on the sonde, with the measure electrode (M) several feet away and the measure return (N) far away. This arrangement is sensitive to the potential gradient between A and B. The spacing is defined by the distance from M to the midpoint between A and B. The most common spacing is 18 ft, 8 in. [5.7 m]. The lateral gives a sharper response to a bed boundary than a normal but also introduces several artifacts that can give misleading results.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/lateral

leaky mode,"A type of acoustic energy that propagates in one direction while being confined in the other two directions, in this case by the borehole wall. Leaky modes can be considered as multiply reflected and constructively interfering waves propagating in the borehole. Each time a compressional wave hits the borehole wall, part of the energy is reflected into the borehole, while the rest is converted to compressional or shear energy that radiates into the formation, hence the term 'leaky'. Leaky modes are dispersive, starting at a certain cutoff frequency with the formation compressional velocity and increasing towards the borehole fluid velocity at high frequency. In slow formations, where no head wave is generated because the borehole fluid is faster than the formation compressional wave, the low-frequency end of the leaky mode can be used to determine formation compressional velocity.

The rock near the borehole is sometimes altered by drilling fluids, stress relief, or both, causing a thin zone whose velocity is lower than that of the true formation. With standard spacings, the wave traveling through the altered zone may arrive first at the receiver, since this zone is closer to both transmitter and receiver. The increased spacing permits the wave traveling through the true formation to arrive first and be measured. The depth of investigation varies with slowness and transmitter-receiver spacing but is of the order of 2 to 3 ft. An increased transmitter-to-receiver spacing also allows better separation of waveforms relating to different acoustic waves, such as compressional, shear and Stoneley arrivals.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/long_spacing_sonic_log

liquid-junction potential,"The electromagnetic force generated by a boundary between solutions of high salinity and low salinity. In a permeable formation, a liquid-junction potential is generated between the invaded zone and the undisturbed zone when the mud filtrate and the formation water have different salinities. This potential is one component of the electrochemical potential, from which the spontaneous potential log is derived. The other, much larger component is the membrane potential at a shale boundary. The liquid-junction potential is reduced if there is clay in the permeable formation, since this generates another, local membrane potential with the opposite polarity to the liquid-junction potential.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/liquid-junction_potential

The relaxation of the hydrogen atoms does not occur immediately but grows exponentially with a time constant T1. There are two mechanisms for longitudinal relaxation, surface relaxation and bulk relaxation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/longitudinal_relaxation
liquid saturation method,"A technique for measuring the pore volume of a core sample from the difference in its weight when dry and when saturated with a liquid. A clean, dry sample is weighed and then evacuated for several hours in a vacuum chamber, flushing with CO2 to remove remaining air if necessary. A de-aerated liquid is introduced into the chamber and pressured to ensure complete saturation. The saturated sample is then weighed again. The difference in weight divided by the density of the liquid is the connected, or effective, pore volume. It is also common to measure the weight of the sample when immersed in the liquid. The grain and bulk volume can then be calculated as in the buoyancy method.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/liquid_saturation_method

Wireline logging tools are typically cylinders from 1.5 to 5 in. [3.8 to 12.7 cm] in diameter. Since the total length is more than can be conveniently handled in one piece, the logging tool is divided into different sections that are assembled at the wellsite. These sections consist of cartridges and sondes. Different measurements can be combined to make up a tool string. The total length of a tool string may range from 10 to 100 ft [3 to 30 m] or more. Flexible joints are added in long tool strings to ease passage in the borehole, and to allow different sections to be centralized or eccentralized. If the total length is very long, it is often preferable to make two or more logging runs with shorter tool strings.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/logging_tool

A depth wheel drives the depth recording system. The data recorder includes a digital recorder and a printer.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/logging_unit
logging,Pertaining to a log.,Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/logging
logging run,"An operation in which a logging tool is lowered into a borehole and then retrieved from the hole while recording measurements. The term is used in three different ways. First, the term refers to logging operations performed at different times during the drilling of a well. For example, Run 3 would be the third time logs had been recorded in that well. Second, the term refers to the number of times a particular log has been run in the well. Third, the term refers to different runs performed during the same logging operation. For example, resistivity and nuclear logs may be combined in one tool string and recorded during the first run, while acoustic and nuclear magnetic resonance logs may be recorded during the second run.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/logging_run
logarithmic mean,"The average value of a set of measurements, calculated by taking the logarithms of the measurements, finding the arithmetic average of the logarithms and then taking the antilogarithm of the average.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/logarithmic_mean
log,"To continuously measure formation properties with electrically powered instruments to infer properties and make decisions about drilling and production operations. The record of the measurements, typically a long strip of paper, is also called a log. Measurements include electrical properties (resistivity and conductivity at various frequencies), sonic properties, active and passive nuclear measurements, dimensional measurements of the wellbore, formation fluid sampling, formation pressure measurement, wireline-conveyed sidewall coring tools, and others. For wireline measurements, the logging tool (or sonde) is lowered into the open wellbore on a multiple conductor, contra-helically armored wireline cable. Once the tool string (link to ID 2964) has reached the bottom of the interval of interest, measurements are taken on the way out of the wellbore. This is done in an attempt to maintain tension on the cable (which stretches) as constant as possible for depth correlation purposes. (The exception to this practice is in certain hostile environments in which the tool electronics might not survive the downhole temperatures for long enough to allow the tool to be lowered to the bottom of the hole and measurements to be recorded while pulling the tool up the hole. In this case, ""down log"" measurements might be conducted on the way into the well, and repeated on the way out if possible.) Most wireline measurements are recorded continuously while the sonde is moving. Certain fluid sampling and pressure-measuring tools require that the sonde be stopped, increasing the chance that the sonde or the cable might become stuck. Logging while drilling (LWD) tools take measurements in much the same way as wireline-logging tools, except that the measurements are taken by a self-contained tool near the bottom of the bottomhole assembly and are recorded downward (as the well is deepened) rather than upward from the bottom of the hole.",Verb,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/l/log
induction,"Related to a wireline log of formation resistivity based on the principle of inducing alternating current loops in the formation and measuring the resultant signal in a receiver. In the simplest device, an alternating current of medium frequency (10?s of kHz) is passed through a transmitter coil, thereby inducing an alternating magnetic field in the formation. This field creates current loops in the formation. The loops produce their own magnetic field, which induce a current when they cross the receiver coil. This signal is proportional to the conductivity of the formation, with contributions from different regions of the formation summing approximately in conductivity. As a result, the induction log is most accurate at high conductivities and with resistive invasion. However, below about 1 ohm-m skin effect becomes important.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/induction
IM,A particular type of induction log designed to read an intermediate distance into the formation while maintaining good vertical resolution. The medium-induction array of eight coils (IM) is produced by three transmitters and five receivers running at 20 kHz. A small fourth transmitter coil was added in tools built since 1968. The midpoint of the integrated radial geometrical factor is 30 in. [76 cm] in radius. The vertical resolution is about 4 ft [1.2 m] but varies with conditions. The IM is combined with a deep-induction log on the same sonde to produce a dual induction log.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/im
imbibition,"The process of absorbing a wetting phase into a porous rock. Imbibition is important in a waterdrive reservoir because it can advance or hinder water movement, affecting areal sweep. Spontaneous imbibition refers to the process of absorption with no pressure driving the phase into the rock. It is possible for the same rock to imbibe both water and oil, with water imbibing at low in situ water saturation, displacing excess oil from the surface of the rock grains, and oil imbibing at low in-situ oil saturation, displacing excess water. An imbibition test is a comparison of the imbibition potential of water and oil into a rock. The wettability of the rock is determined by which phase imbibes more.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/imbibition

induction electrical survey,"A combination of a 6FF40 induction log with an electrode measurement such as a 16-in. [40-cm] short normal. In some cases other induction arrays, such as the 5FF27, may have been used. The use of both measurements in the induction electrical survey (IES) gave a qualitative indication of invasion.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/induction_electrical_survey
inertial resistance,"The extra resistance of a porous medium to fluid flow, beyond that predicted by Darcy's law, caused by local accelerations within the tortuous pore volume. The inertial resistance is proportional to the fluid density times the flow rate. The inertial resistance is significant with gas because flow rates can be high. In laboratory measurements of permeability, inertial resistance can be important for high-permeability samples where high flow rates are needed to have significant pressure gradients. The effect is corrected by using the Forchheimer equation and making measurements at several flow rates (often through an unsteady state test).",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/inertial_resistance
inelastic neutron scattering,"A neutron interaction in which part of the kinetic energy lost by a neutron in a nuclear collision excites the nucleus. The excited nucleus will usually emit characteristic gamma rays upon de-excitation. Inelastic neutron scattering is possible only if the neutron energy exceeds a characteristic threshold for the element. Inelastic neutron scattering is the principle behind the carbon-oxygen log, which is used to determine water saturation behind casing.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/inelastic_neutron_scattering
in-situ fluid analysis,Analysis performed by downhole tools to determine physical and chemical properties of fluids. Typical analyses that can be performed downhole include basic density and viscosity measurements at sampling pressure and temperature.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/in-situ_fluid_analysis
induced gamma ray spectroscopy,"The principle of an activation log, which is a log of elemental concentrations derived from the characteristic energy levels of gamma rays emitted by a nucleus that has been activated by neutron bombardment. The term is often used to refer specifically to the pulsed neutron spectroscopy measurement.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/induced_gamma_ray_spectroscopy
iterative forward modeling,"The use of repeated forward modeling of a logging tool response to produce modeled logs that very closely match the measured logs. The final model is then the log analyst's best estimate of the formation properties. Iterative forward modeling is a hand-operated inversion. The technique is used mainly for laterologs and induction logs when the formation or the environment are complex, so that the environmental effects cannot be separated and treated individually by automatic inversion. Iterative forward modeling allows the log analyst to use local knowledge and petrophysics to select between the many possible solutions that are mathematically correct. These cases occur most often in horizontal wells, or vertical wells with the combined effects of invasion and large resistivity contrast between beds.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/iterative_forward_modeling
in situ viscosity evaluation,"Downhole measurement of fluid viscosity, typically performed either with logging tools based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or with sampling tools such as formation testers.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/in_situ_viscosity_evaluation

Typical analyses that can be performed downhole include basic density and viscosity measurements at sampling pressure and temperature.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/in_situ_fluid_analysis
irreducible water,"The lowest water saturation, Swi, that can be achieved in a core plug by displacing the water by oil or gas. The state is usually achieved by flowing oil or gas through a water-saturated sample, or spinning it in a centrifuge to displace the water with oil or gas. The term is somewhat imprecise because the irreducible water saturation is dependent on the final drive pressure (when flowing oil or gas) or the maximum speed of rotation (in a centrifuge). The related term connate water saturation is the lowest water saturation found in situ.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/irreducible_water
isolated porosity,"The pore volume not connected to the pore network. Isolated porosity can be significant in volcanic rocks and some carbonates, for example as vugular, moldic and intraparticle porosity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/isolated_porosity
invasion,"The process by which mud filtrate, and sometimes whole mud, enters a permeable formation. The mud filtrate displaces some or all of the moveable fluids in the formation, leaving an invaded zone. The invasion process is complex. It is generally considered to start with a short initial spurt loss when the bit penetrates the rock. During this period, invasion depends on formation permeability, among other factors. A mudcake is soon formed, after which invasion is either described as dynamic, when mud is being circulated, or static, when it is not. In both cases, the volume of invasion depends little on formation properties and strongly on other factors such as mudcake permeability and differential pressure. However, the profile of the invasion front within the formation, both vertically and radially, does depend on formation properties. With high permeability and with different densities of filtrate and formation fluid, gravity can cause vertical movement of the filtrate, leading to different depths of invasion at the top and bottom of a zone. With two moveable phases (oil and water) and differing permeabilities, an annulus can be formed. The radial profile from the wellbore out to the undisturbed zone depends on permeability, with lower permeabilities leading to sharper transitions.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/invasion
inverse,"Referring to a type of conventional electrical log in which the current-emitting and the current-return electrodes (A and B) are placed close together on the sonde, with the measure electrode (M) several feet away and the measure return (N) far away. This arrangement is sensitive to the potential gradient between A and B. The spacing is defined by the distance from M to the midpoint between A and B. The most common spacing is 18 ft, 8 in. [5.7 m]. The lateral gives a sharper response to a bed boundary than a normal but also introduces several artifacts that can give misleading results.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/inverse
invaded zone,"The volume close to the borehole wall in which some or all of the moveable fluids have been displaced by mud filtrate. It consists of the flushed zone and the transition zone or annulus. In simple models, the invaded zone and the flushed zone are considered synonymous.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/invaded_zone
inverse filter,"Generally, a finite impulse response (FIR) filter that has been designed to transform the usually irregular vertical response functions of raw measurements into a smooth, well-behaved response function such as a Gaussian response or a Kaiser window function. The criteria for designing inverse filters can include vertical response, depth of investigation and near-field (cave effect) response. Inverse filters have been used for many years to improve the response of induction arrays.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/inverse_filter

interwell tomography,"A technique for measuring a signal that is broadcast from a transmitter or source located in one well, to a receiver array placed in a neighboring well. This technique is used to create a display of formation properties such as acoustic velocity and attenuation, seismic reflectivity, or electromagnetic resistivity in the area between wells. The reservoir-scale data acquired with this technique can be used to bridge the gap between wellbore measurements and surface measurements.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/i/interwell_tomography
J factor,"Another term for pseudogeometrical factor, the response of a logging measurement as a function of distance from the tool. The pseudogeometrical factor is normally radial, reflecting the response perpendicular to the tool. It can be a differential factor, which is the contribution to the signal at a particular distance, but is more normally integrated, which is the sum of all signals from the tool to a particular distance. The pseudogeometrical factor developed from the concept of the geometrical factor, and is expressed in the same way. For example, for a radial distance x from the tool, the integrated radial pseudogeometrical factor, Jx, can be written as: Jx = (Ux - Ut) / (Uxo - Ut) where Ut is the log reading of the undisturbed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with no invasion), Uxo is the log reading of the flushed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with infinite invasion), and Ux is the log reading with a step profile invasion to depth x. Unlike the geometrical factor, Jx depends on the values of both Uxo and Ut. Pseudogeometrical factors are a useful way to express the radial response (or vertical response) in typical conditions. The physics of each measurement determines how much Jx varies with Uxo and Ut. Pseudogeometrical factors are often used to express the response of nuclear and resistivity logs, but are not appropriate for acoustic and electromagnetic propagation logs (where the response is too dependent on the contrast in properties), or nuclear magnetic resonance logs (where the response is too localized).",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/j/j_factor
neutron capture,"A neutron interaction in which the neutron is absorbed by the target nucleus, producing an isotope in an excited state. The activated isotope de-excites instantly through the emission of characteristic gamma rays. Neutron capture, also called thermal capture, usually occurs at low thermal energies at which the neutrons have about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically below 0.4 eV (0.025 eV at room temperature). Some elements are better thermal absorbers than others. Neutron capture is an important principle behind the pulsed neutron capture log, the elemental capture spectroscopy log, the pulsed neutron spectroscopy log and the thermal neutron porosity measurement.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/neutron_capture
neutron generator,"A device for producing high-energy neutrons by using a charged particle accelerator. Neutron generators are used in various pulsed neutron devices and some neutron porosity measurements. In a typical device, deuterium (2D) and tritium (3T) ions are accelerated towards a target also containing the same isotopes. When 2D and 3T collide, they react to produce a neutron with an energy of about 14.1 MeV. The first neutron generators were built in the late 1950s and soon led to the first pulsed neutron capture log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/neutron_generator
neutron interactions,"Phenomena involving the transfer of energy from neutrons to nuclei. The reaction rate of neutrons with matter depends on the density of neutrons, their velocity, the nuclear density and the particular interaction cross section. There are four principal neutron interactions that affect formation evaluation: elastic neutron scattering, inelastic neutron scattering, fast-neutron reactions and neutron capture.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/neutron_interactions
neutron porosity,"Referring to a log of porosity based on the effect of the formation on fast neutrons emitted by a source. Hydrogen has by far the biggest effect in slowing down and capturing neutrons. Since hydrogen is found mainly in the pore fluids, the neutron porosity log responds principally to porosity. However, the matrix and the type of fluid also have an effect. The log is calibrated to read the correct porosity assuming that the pores are filled with fresh water and for a given matrix (limestone, sandstone or dolomite). It is presented in units of porosity (vol/vol or p.u.) for the matrix chosen. Older logs were presented in counts per second or API units. The depth of investigation is several inches, so that the log reads mainly in the flushed zone. The neutron porosity log is strongly affected by clay and gas. Hydrogen occurs in clays and hydrated minerals as well as pore fluids. Gas has a low hydrogen density, so that gas zones have a very low apparent porosity. The measurement is based on either thermal or epithermal neutron detection. Thermal neutrons have about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically less than 0.4 eV, while epithermal neutrons have higher energy, between about 0.4 and 10 eV. Being a statistical measurement, the precision is greatest at high count rates, which in this case occurs at low porosity. Neutron porosity logs were introduced in the early 1940s. The first tools were known as neutron-gamma tools, since the detector measured the gamma rays emitted on capture. Neutron-neutron tools, using a thermal neutron detector were introduced in about 1950.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/neutron_porosity
neutron log,"Normally synonymous with a neutron porosity log. However, the term is sometimes broadened to include an activation log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/neutron_log
natural gamma ray spectroscopy,"The technique of measuring the spectrum, or number and energy, of gamma rays emitted as natural radioactivity by the formation. There are three sources of natural radioactivity in the Earth: 40K, 232Th and 238U, or potassium, thorium and uranium. These radioactive isotopes emit gamma rays that have characteristic energy levels. The quantity and energy of these gamma rays can be measured in a scintillation detector. A log of natural gamma ray spectroscopy is usually presented as a total gamma ray log and the weight fraction of potassium (%), thorium (ppm) and uranium (ppm). The primary standards for the weight fractions are formations with known quantities of the three isotopes. Natural gamma ray spectroscopy logs were introduced in the early 1970s, although they had been studied from the 1950s.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/natural_gamma_ray_spectroscopy

normal mode,"A type of acoustic energy that propagates in one direction while being confined in the other two directions, in this case by the borehole wall. Normal modes are propagated as reflections off the borehole wall, and exist only in hard rock. They are highly dispersive, starting with the formation shear velocity at a certain cutoff frequency and decreasing at high frequencies to the borehole fluid velocity. Below the cutoff frequency, they do not exist. Normal mode #0 is often considered to be the tube wave and starts at zero frequency. Normal mode #1 is called the pseudoRayleigh, and starts at around 5 kHz. The other normal modes start at increasingly higher frequencies.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/normal_mode
normal,"Referring to a type of conventional electrical log in which the current emitting electrode (A) and the measure electrode (M) are placed close together on the sonde, and the current return electrode (B) and the measure reference electrode (N) far away. The response is determined mainly by the distance between A and M. The larger AM, the deeper the measurement, but the poorer the bed boundary response. Although many distances have been used, the most common are 16 in [40 cm], known as the short normal, and 64 in [162 cm], known as the long normal.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/normal
nuclear magnetic resonance,"A phenomenon by which a nucleus absorbs electromagnetic radiation of a specific frequency in the presence of a strong magnetic field. Isidor Isaac Rabi (1898 to 1988), an American physicist born in Austria, first detected magnetic resonance in 1938. Since then, magnetic resonance has been applied to the detection of light atoms (such as hydrogen in hydrocarbons) and as a nondestructive way to study the human body.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/nuclear_magnetic_resonance
nuclear magnetic resonance measurement,A measurement of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) properties of hydrogen in the formation.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/nuclear_magnetic_resonance_measurement
NMR,"Pertaining to a measurement of the nuclear magnetic properties of formation hydrogen. The basic core and log measurement is the T2 decay, presented as a distribution of T2 amplitudes versus time at each sample depth, typically from 0.3 ms to 3 s. The T2 decay is further processed to give the total pore volume (the total porosity) and pore volumes within different ranges of T2. The most common volumes are the bound fluid and free fluid. A permeability estimate is made using a transform such as the Timur-Coates or SDR permeability transforms. By running the log with different acquisition parameters, direct hydrocarbon typing and enhanced diffusion are possible.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/n/nmr

Similar compounds in oil-base mud also can cause a previously water-wet rock to become partially or totally oil-wet.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oil-wet
oilfield battery,"An electrochemical source that provides electrical power to a downhole or surface tool used for determining the location or assisting in the extraction of hydrocarbons. Unlike a conventional battery, an oilfield battery must safely provide power sufficient to enable a tool to perform as specified, even on extended jobs. Designed with rugged external packaging to fit within a confined tool space, it must tolerate extreme temperatures while withstanding high shock and vibration. Its internal chemistry must also accommodate a long shelf life.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oilfield_battery
oxide-closure model,"A model for converting relative elemental yields from a pulsed neutron spectroscopy log to absolute weight concentrations using the assumption that the sum of all oxides in the rock matrix is 1. The model is based on the observation that, with few exceptions, sedimentary minerals are oxides, so that the sum of the dry weight percent of all oxides must be 100%. The weight percent of an oxide can be calculated from the dry weight percent of the cation by knowing the chemical formula (for example, SiO2 from Si). The absolute dry weight percent, W, of element i is given by Wi = F * Yi / Si where F is the unknown normalization factor, Yi is the measured spectral gamma ray yield and Si is the tool sensitivity to that element, measured in the laboratory. The dry weight percent of the oxide is then Oi = F* Xi * Yi / Si where Xi is the oxide association factor, given by the chemical formula. Since the sum of all Oi equals 1, it is possible to calculate F and determine each Wi .",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/oxide-closure_model
photoelectric effect,"A gamma ray interaction in which the gamma ray is fully absorbed by a bound electron. If the energy transferred exceeds the binding energy to the atom, the electron will be ejected. Normally, the ejected electron will be replaced within the material and a characteristic X-ray will be emitted with an energy that is dependent on the atomic number of the material. The highest probability for this effect occurs at low gamma ray energy and in a material of high atomic number. The photoelectric effect is the principle behind the PEF log, which identifies lithology.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/photoelectric_effect
Pickett plot,"A double logarithmic plot of a resistivity measurement on the x-axis versus a porosity measurement on the y-axis. The plot is named after G.R. Pickett. The plot is based on taking the logarithm of the Archie equation. Points of constant water saturation (Sw) will plot on a straight line with negative slope of value m. Water zones define the lowermost line on the plot. Since Sw = 1, the water resistivity can be determined from a point on the line. Once the water line is established, other parallel lines can be drawn for different Sw, assuming a constant n (usually 2). Other data can then be plotted and interpreted in terms of Sw. The same technique can be applied to the flushed zone, using flushed-zone measurements.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pickett_plot
pickup,"The depth at which the tool string is picked up off the bottom of the well during a wireline logging survey. Pick-up can be observed by an increase in cable tension and by the start of activity in the log curves. When the logging tool is lowered to the bottom of the well, it is common practice to spool in some extra cable. When the cable is pulled back out, the tool remains stationary before it is picked up off the bottom. During this time the log readings are static but the depth, which is recorded by the movement of the cable, is changing.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pickup
phase-shift resistivity,"The ability of the formation to resist electrical conduction, as derived from the change in position of the peaks of an electromagnetic wave generated in a propagation resistivity measurement. At the frequencies used, the phase shift depends mainly on the resistivity of the material with a small dependence on dielectric permittivity, particularly at high resistivity. Common practice is to transform the phase shift to resistivity assuming that the dielectric permittivity is related to resistivity by a simple algorithm. The transform also depends on transmitter/receiver spacings and tool design. For a 2-MHz measurement, a typical measurement range is 0.2 to 200 ohm-m. Above 200 ohm-m, the dielectric effects become too variable and it is preferable to use the dielectric resistivity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/phase-shift_resistivity
phase shift,"The change in position of the peaks of a sinusoidal electromagnetic wave as it passes through the formation. If the sinusoidal wave picked up by two receivers a certain distance apart in a formation are compared, it is found that the wave has been attenuated and shifted in time.

The gamma ray energy must equal at least the rest mass of an electron and a positron (1.022 MeV) for the interaction to be possible. Following pair production, the positron will annihilate with an electron, emitting two gamma rays of 0.511 MeV.

permeameter,"An apparatus for measuring the permeability of a core sample. Measurements are made either by placing the sample in a chamber (also known as a core holder), or by placing a probe on the surface of the sample. Core-holder measurements are made either with gas or liquid, and either in steady state or unsteady-state conditions. Other variables include the confining pressure and the direction of measurement, which can be axial (along the axis of a cylindrical core sample), transverse (perpendicular to the axis), or radial (to the center of a hollow cylinder). In probe measurements, gas is injected into the sample under either steady- or unsteady-state conditions. Probe permeameters are also known as minipermeameters.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/permeameter
permanent datum,"The level to which all subsurface depths in an area are referred, normally the mean sea level. In individual wells, the depth is measured from the depth reference.

pass,"With reference to logging, an operation in which a logging tool is lowered into a borehole and then retrieved from it while recording measurements.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pass
PEF,"A log of photoelectric absorption properties. The log measures the photoelectric absorption factor, Pe, which is defined as (Z/10) 3.6 where Z is the average atomic number of the formation. Pe is unitless, but since it is proportional to the photoelectric cross section per electron, it is sometimes quoted in barns/electron. Since fluids have very low atomic numbers, they have very little influence, so that Pe is a measure of the rock matrix properties. Sandstones have low Pe, while dolomites and limestones have high Pe. Clays, heavy minerals and iron-bearing minerals have high Pe. Thus, the log is very useful for determining mineralogy. In interpretation, PEF is normally converted to the simpler volumetric cross section, U in barns/cm3, by taking the product of PEF and density. The log is recorded as part of the density measurement. The depth of investigation is of the order of one inch, which is normally in the flushed zone. PEF can be affected by heavy minerals such as barite in the mudcake or mud filtrate. PEF logs were introduced in the late 1970s.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pef
polarization horn,"The effect on a propagation resistivity or induction log of charge buildup at the boundary between two formation layers with different dielectric properties. In a vertical well with horizontal layers, the current loops generated by the tool in the formation are parallel to the layers and do not cross bed boundaries. However, with an apparent dip between borehole and formation, the loops cross the bed boundaries and generate a charge buildup at the boundaries. The charge buildup acts like a secondary transmitter that increases the measured resistivity. The result is a spike to high resistivity as the tool crosses the bed boundary. In deviated or horizontal wells, polarization horns on measurements-while-drilling propagation logs often are used to detect a bed boundary. The spike increases with apparent dip and resistivity contrast between beds. The magnitude of polarization spikes varies with tool type and spacing, being larger for the propagation tools.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/polarization_horn
polarization time,"The time allotted for the alignment of the spins of hydrogen atoms with the static magnetic field during a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement. The alignment follows an exponential rule such that, after a polarization time PT, the fraction of aligned spins is 1 – e–PT/T1, where T1 is their longitudinal relaxation time. An infinite polarization time is therefore needed to full polarization, but 95% polarization is reached after a time of 3*T1. Typical acquisition polarization times for a standard NMR log are between 1 and 4 s, mostly depending on the acquisition sequence and logging speed. Some tools benefit from prepolarization with an asymmetrical permanent magnet so that the effective polarization time may be larger than the acquisition polarization time. (An example is the CMR tool.)",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/polarization_time
propagation resistivity,"A measurements-while-drilling log of formation resistivity. The log normally contains at least one attenuation and one phase-shift resistivity reading. In many cases there will be multiple curves of both, the difference being the depth of investigation. For the same nominal depth of investigation, the attenuation resistivity reads deeper than the phase-shift resistivity and is less affected by invasion, but more affected by surrounding beds and apparent dip. The attenuation measurement has a poorer vertical resolution and is less affected by anisotropy. Depths of investigation and vertical resolution of both measurements vary with the average formation resistivity. Although depths of investigation are less than with wireline resistivity logs, the invasion at the time of measurement is usually small and it is possible to derive the resistivity of the undisturbed zone.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/propagation_resistivity
pulse echo,"A technique in which an ultrasonic transducer, in transmit mode, emits a high-frequency acoustic pulse towards the borehole wall, where it is reflected back to the same transducer operating in receive mode. The measurement consists of the amplitude of the received signal, the time between emission and reception, and sometimes the full waveform received. Tools that use this technique either have multiple transducers, facing in different directions, or rotate the transducer while making measurements, thereby obtaining a full image of the borehole wall. Pulse-echo techniques are used in the borehole televiewer. In cased hole, the waveform is analyzed to give indications of cement-bond quality and casing corrosion.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pulse_echo
propagation resistivity measurement,"A measurement of the formation resistivity made on drillpipe at a frequency in the range of 100 kHz to 10 GHz, most commonly 2 MHz. The basic measurement is accomplished using a transmitter and two receivers. At these frequencies, the response is best explained as the propagation of a wave. Thus, the phase shift and attenuation of the wave between the receivers are measured and transformed to give the phase shift and the attenuation resistivity. In practice, multiple transmitters may be used to obtain different depths of investigation and achieve borehole compensation. The wavelength is such that the borehole has a minor effect, but one for which correction may be needed.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/propagation_resistivity_measurement
pulsed neutron spectroscopy log,"A wireline log of the yields of different elements in the formation, measured using induced gamma ray spectroscopy with a pulsed neutron generator. The elemental yields are derived from two intermediate results: the inelastic and the capture spectrum. The inelastic spectrum is the basis for the carbon-oxygen log, and can also give information on other elements. The capture spectrum depends on many elements, mainly hydrogen, silicon, calcium, iron, sulfur and chlorine. Since the elemental yields give information only on the relative concentration of elements, they are normally given as ratios, such as C/O, Cl/H, Si/(Si + Ca), H/(Si + Ca) and Fe/(Si + Ca). These ratios are indicators of oil, salinity, lithology, porosity and clay, respectively. To get absolute concentrations, it is necessary to calibrate to cores or, more often, use a model such as the oxide-closure model. The depth of investigation of the log is several inches into the formation. It can be run in open or cased hole. Pulsed neutron spectroscopy logs were introduced in the mid 1970s after a decade or more of investigation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pulsed_neutron_spectroscopy_log
PSP,A mnemonic for the pseudostatic spontaneous potential.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/psp
propagation time,"A measurement of the high frequency (about 1 GHz) dielectric properties of the formation. In a typical tool, a microwave transmitter is placed a few inches below two receivers separated by 4 cm [1.6 in.]. At this frequency, the response is best explained as the propagation of a wave. Thus the phase shift and attenuation of the wave between the receivers are measured and transformed to give the log measurements of propagation time and attenuation. Because of the short spacings, the measurement has excellent vertical resolution and reads within inches of the borehole wall except at high resistivity. Different transmitter and receiver spacings and orientations are used, leading to different arrays, such as the endfire array and the broadside array. An ideal measurement would give the plane wave properties of the formation. However, the geometry of the measurement precludes this, so that a correction, known as the spreading-loss correction, is needed for the attenuation and to a much smaller extent for the propagation time. The measurement is also affected by the dielectric properties and thickness of the mudcake. Borehole compensation is used to correct for sonde tilt or a rough borehole wall.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/propagation_time
pulsed neutron spectroscopy measurement,"A measurement of the spectrum of gamma rays emitted by a formation bombarded by high-energy neutrons. Neutrons are emitted by a high-energy neutron generator (14.1 MeV). The neutrons interact with different nuclei, which may emit characteristic gamma rays through inelastic neutron scattering, fast-neutron reactions and neutron capture. When pulses from a neutron generator are used, it is possible to separate the different interactions in time after each neutron pulse. Inelastic and fast-neutron interactions occur very soon after the neutron burst, while most of the capture events occur later. The two types can therefore be separated to give a so-called inelastic spectrum and a capture spectrum. The spectra are analyzed either by counting gamma rays in windows placed at the main peaks for the elements concerned, or by comparison with spectral standards, or by combining the two (alpha processing). The resultant logs are known as pulsed neutron spectroscopy logs, the most common of which are the carbon-oxygen log and the elemental capture spectroscopy log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pulsed_neutron_spectroscopy_measurement
proximity log,"An electrode device with small spacings from which the current flow, and hence the measurement, is focused a short distance into the formation. The proximity log measures the resistivity of the flushed zone with minimum influence from the mudcake or the undisturbed zone. The central current-emitting electrode (A0) is surrounded by a guard electrode that emits sufficient current to focus the current from A0 a certain distance into the formation. The electrodes are mounted on a pad that is pressed against the borehole wall. In a typical tool design, 90% of the signal comes from within 5 to 10 in. [13 to 25 cm] of the pad. This is deeper than the microlaterolog, which ensures that the mudcake has less effect but means that the proximity log is more often affected by the undisturbed zone.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/proximity_log
pseudogeometrical factor,"The response of a logging measurement as a function of distance from the tool. The pseudogeometrical factor is normally radial, reflecting the response perpendicular to the tool. It can be a differential factor, which is the contribution to the signal at a particular distance, but is more normally integrated, which is the sum of all signals from the tool to a particular distance. The pseudogeometrical factor developed from the concept of the geometrical factor, and is expressed in the same way. For example, for a radial distance x from the tool, the integrated radial pseudogeometrical factor, Jx, can be written as: Jx = (Ux - Ut) / (Uxo - Ut) where Ut is the log reading of the undisturbed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with no invasion), Uxo is the log reading of the flushed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with infinite invasion), and Ux is the log reading with a step profile invasion to depth x. Unlike the geometrical factor, Jx depends on the values of both Uxo and Ut. Pseudogeometrical factors are a useful way to express the radial response (or vertical response) in typical conditions. The physics of each measurement determines how much Jx varies with Uxo and Ut. Pseudogeometrical factors are often used to express the response of nuclear and resistivity logs, but are not appropriate for acoustic and electromagnetic propagation logs (where the response is too dependent on the contrast in properties), or nuclear magnetic resonance logs (where the response is too localized).",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pseudogeometrical_factor
pseudostatic spontaneous potential,"The ideal spontaneous potential (SP) that would be observed opposite a shaly, permeable bed if the SP currents were prevented from flowing. In the middle of a thick, permeable bed whose resistivity is not too high, the SP reads close to the pseudostatic spontaneous potential (PSP). In other conditions, however, the SP may be significantly less than the PSP. The PSP ignores other potential sources and assumes that a surrounding shale is a perfect cationic membrane. The ratio of the PSP to the static spontaneous potential is known as the SP reduction factor, alpha. Alpha is less than 1 and is a function of the shaliness, or cation-exchange capacity, within the sand. The higher this cation-exchange capacity, the larger the internal membrane potential. The latter has the opposite polarity to the liquid-junction potential and reduces the SP. The PSP, and alpha, are reduced when hydrocarbons are introduced into shaly sands, because the cation-exchange capacity in the sands is forced into a smaller conductive pore volume and therefore has a larger relative effect.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pseudostatic_spontaneous_potential
potassium,"An element with an atomic number of 19. The 40K isotope is radioactive, decaying with the emission of a single gamma ray of 1.46 MeV with a half-life of 1.3 * 109 years to give a stable isotope of argon. Potassium is the largest source of natural radioactivity. It occurs in illite, alkali feldspars, micas and some evaporite minerals. It also occurs in some drilling mud systems. The 40K isotope is only a small fraction, about 0.012%, of the total potassium, the main isotope being 39K, which has an abundance of about 1.7% in the Earth's crust. For the purposes of logging, the total potassium is calculated from the measured quantity of 40K and scaled in percent by weight. It is a valuable aid in determining the mineral content of a formation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/potassium
porosimeter,"An instrument for measuring the pore volume, and hence the porosity, of a core sample. The term is also used for some instruments that actually measure grain volume, such as the Boyle's Law Double-Cell method. Pore volume is then obtained from the difference between bulk volume and grain volume. Pore volume is most commonly measured directly by Boyle's Law Single-Cell method, summation of fluids or liquid saturation. Bulk volume is most commonly measured by buoyancy, mercury displacement or a physical measurement of size (calipering); grain volume by Boyle's law Double-Cell method or disaggregation of the sample. Except for disaggregation, all techniques determine the effective porosity, in the sense of all but the isolated pores.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/porosimeter
pore throat,"In an intergranular rock, the small pore space at the point where two grains meet, which connects two larger pore volumes. The number, size and distribution of the pore throats control many of the resistivity, flow and capillary-pressure characteristics of the rock.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/pore_throat
porosity exponent,"The exponent, m, in the relation of formation factor (F) to porosity (phi). For a single sample, F is related to phi using the Archie equation F = 1 / phim, with m being the only coefficient needed. In this case, m has been related to many physical parameters, but above all to the tortuosity of the pore space. In theory, it can range from 1 for a bundle of tubes to infinity for porosity that is completely unconnected. For a simple packing of equal spheres, m = 1.5. With a more tortuous pore space or more isolated pores, m increases, while with fractures or conductive solids, m decreases. As a general average for typical reservoir rocks, m is often taken as 2. For a group of rock samples, it is common practice to find a relationship between F and phi that uses two coefficients (F = a / phim). In this case m, like a, becomes an empirical constant of best fit between F and phi, and may take a wide range of values. In complex formations, such as shaly sands or carbonates with multiple pore types, a constant m does not give good results. One solution is to vary m, with the variability related to parameters such as porosity, shaliness, or rock texture, or else determined directly from logs in zones where the water saturation is known or can be computed from a nonresistivity measurement such as electromagnetic propagation. In shaly sands, the preferred solution is to use a saturation equation, such as Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS or CRMM, in which m is defined as the intrinsic m, determined from the intrinsic formation factor at high salinities or after correction for the effect of shale. In carbonates with multiple pore types, such as fractures, vugs, interparticle porosity and microporosity, one solution is to use equations with different porosity exponents for each pore type. The volume of each pore type must then be determined from logs or borehole images.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/porosity_exponent
porous plate technique,"A method for desaturating a core sample by placing one end in capillary contact with a porous plate and applying gas or oil under pressure to the remaining surfaces. The liquid in the original fully saturated sample is expelled through the porous plate. At different pressure stages, the sample is weighed to determine the loss of liquid, and the gas or oil pressure increased. Desaturation continues until no more weight loss is observed, at which time the sample is at irreducible water saturation. Core samples are desaturated to measure, for example, capillary pressure, irreducible water saturation, resistivity index or nuclear magnetic resonance response.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/porous_plate_technique
porosity unit,A unit equal to the percentage of pore space in a unit volume of rock. It is abbreviated to p.u. and lies between 0 and 100.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/porosity_unit
preserved core,"A core that has been preserved in the same state as when it was brought to the surface. The term implies that the core has been stored for a period before analysis. If this has not been the case, it is known as fresh core. The goal of preservation is to maintain the original fluid content, fluid distribution, rock wettability and mechanical integrity. Preserved cores are typically sealed and protected from mechanical damage. Depending on the core and the objective, they may also be frozen or placed in humidity ovens. Preservation may be wet, in which the core is submerged in a suitably prepared brine, or dry, without any fluid.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/preserved_core
precision,"The closeness of agreement between the results obtained by applying a measurement procedure several times on identical materials and under prescribed measurement conditions. The smaller the random part of experimental error, the more precise the measurement procedure. In logging, the term usually describes the repeatability of a statistical measurement, such as a nuclear log. The precision must then refer to a particular set of conditions, for example, the speed of logging and the formation properties.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/precision
quadrant density,A log of formation density from one of the quadrants of an azimuthal density tool.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/q/quadrant_density
quicklook,A subset of a 3D seismic survey comprising low fold or simplified processing (such as omitting dip moveout processing) that can be evaluated soon after acquisition.,Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/q/quicklook
unconfined compressive strength (UCS),A measure of a material’s strength. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) is the maximum axial compressive stress that a right-cylindrical sample of material can withstand under unconfined conditions—the confining stress is zero. It is also known as the uniaxial compressive strength of a material because the application of compressive stress is only along one axis—the longitudinal axis—of the sample.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/unconfined_compressive_strength
uranium,"An element with an atomic number of 92. The 238U isotope is radioactive and decays with a half-life of 4.4 * 109 years through a series of intermediate isotopes to a stable isotope of lead. The intermediate isotopes emit a wide range of gamma rays, the most prominent being that of bismuth, 214Bi. It is assumed that formations are in secular equilibrium; that is, the relative proportions of parent and daughter isotopes remain constant, and the measured spectrum is directly related to the amount of 238U. The concentration in the Earth?s crust is about 4 ppm by weight. Uranium-bearing minerals are rare. Uranium is a soluble trace element that is transported easily and can be precipitated far from its source. It is most frequently found in carbonates and organic materials. A log of uranium is presented in parts per million, ppm. It is useful for detecting organic material, but is otherwise considered not useful for quantitative evaluation. In the corrected gamma ray log, the uranium contribution is removed to differentiate carbonates from shales.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/uranium
uncertainty,"Result of the evaluation aimed at characterizing the range within which the true value of a quantity is estimated to lie, generally with a given likelihood. (ISO) The uncertainty is the amount of possible inaccuracy. It is often a statistical estimate of this range, such as the half-width of a gaussian distribution. The quantity may have been measured or derived from an equation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/uncertainty
ultrasonic measurement,"In the context of borehole logging, measurements of acoustic signals that are in the hundreds of kilohertz to the low-megahertz range. Such ultrasonic instruments are mostly of the pulse-echo type, and are used in the borehole televiewer, and in various cased-hole devices to determine corrosion and cement-bond quality.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/ultrasonic_measurement
ultralong-spaced electrical log,"A conventional electrical log with very long electrode spacing. The ultralong-spaced electrical log (ULSEL) is a normal device with a distance between the current-emitting electrode and the measure electrode of between about 75 ft [23 m] and 1000 ft [305 m]. The long spacings are designed to locate objects within tens of feet of the borehole. These objects may be a salt dome or casing, in the case of a relief well.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/ultra-long_spaced_electrical_log
unsteady state,"A system that is in a transient state at the time of a measurement. In the case of permeability measurements on core samples, two transient techniques are used. In the pressure falloff method, the sample is at atmospheric pressure, either in a chamber or under a probe. Fluid at a higher pressure is released into one end of the sample. The decay of pressure with time at that end of the sample is recorded and analyzed by techniques similar to those used for transient well tests. In the pulse-decay method, the sample is held in a chamber and connected to two reservoirs, all of which are filled with a fluid at high pressure. The pressure in one of the reservoirs is increased a small amount and then re-connected to the sample. The change in pressure with time of this sample is recorded and analyzed using flow equations.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/unsteady_state
uniaxial compressive strength,A measure of a material’s strength. The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) is the maximum axial compressive stress that a right-cylindrical sample of material can withstand before failing. It is also known as the unconfined compressive strength of a material because confining stress is set to zero.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/uniaxial_compressive_strength
undrained test,Test in which the fluid in the sample is not able to flow and equilibrate to imposed pore pressure conditions; the fluid mass remains the same while the fluid volume and pressure will vary.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/undrained_test
undisturbed zone,The part of the formation that has not been affected by invasion.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/undisturbed_zone
verification,A check performed at the wellsite to establish whether a logging measurement is functioning properly. Verification is also known as an operational check. The verification may be done before or after the survey and may be presented with the log. Verification is distinct from calibration.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/verification
vertical resistivity,"The resistivity of a formation measured by flowing current in a vertical plane. In anisotropic formations, the horizontal and vertical resistivities are different. In a vertical well, wireline induction logs and measurements-while-drilling propagation logs measure the horizontal resistivity, whereas laterologs measure the horizontal resistivity with some component of the vertical. In deviated and horizontal wells, all these logs measure some mixture of both vertical and horizontal resistivity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/vertical_resistivity
verification listing,A description of the contents of a digital record.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/verification_listing
variable-density log,"A presentation of the acoustic waveform at a receiver of a sonic or ultrasonic measurement, in which the amplitude is presented in color or the shades of a gray scale. The variable-density log is commonly used as an adjunct to the cement-bond log, and offers better insights into its interpretation; in most cases microannulus and fast-formation-arrival effects can be identified using this additional display. In openhole, it may be displayed alongside the sonic log transit-time as a qualitative presentation of the acoustic wave train, and is sometimes used for fracture detection by examination of the chevron patterns given by Stoneley wave reflections (and other wave reflections) at fractures crossing the borehole.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/variable-density_log
vertical resolution,"A distance that characterizes the ability of a logging tool to resolve changes parallel to the tool axis. The word vertical implies a vertical well, but the term is used at other wellbore deviations. The vertical resolution summarizes the vertical response of the measurement in one or more distances. Most quoted vertical resolutions assume a homogeneous formation with stated properties. Vertical resolutions can vary considerably in more complex conditions, and at different values of the properties concerned. They should be considered only a qualitative guide to tool response. There are several different definitions of the vertical resolution distance. First, and most commonly, it is the interval within which a large percentage, typically 90%, of the vertical response occurs. Second, it is the minimum bed thickness needed for the measurement to read within a small percentage, typically 10%, of the true value at the center of the bed. Third, it may refer to the smallest bed thickness for which a significant change can be detected by the measurement. For acoustic and electromagnetic propagation measurements, it is taken, with reasonable accuracy, as the span of the receiver array. For nuclear and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, which must be acquired during a significant time interval, the vertical resolution also depends on the logging speed and the precision required.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/vertical_resolution
vertical response,"The response of a logging measurement as a function of distance parallel to the tool axis. The word vertical implies a vertical well, but the term is used at other wellbore deviations. Vertical responses are determined by computer simulation or laboratory measurement. For some measurements, mainly resistivity, the vertical response can be shaped as desired through signal processing. In general, the vertical response depends on the formation properties throughout the measurement volume. Most quoted vertical responses have been determined in formations that are radially homogeneous and have small vertical changes. They can then be summarized by a geometrical factor or a pseudogeometrical factor. These factors are appropriate for volumetric measurements such as nuclear and resistivity, but not for others such as acoustic propagation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/vertical_response
volumetric cross section,"The cross section of a material to photoelectric absorption, in barns/cm3. The volumetric cross section, U, is from the product of the photoelectric factor, PEF or Pe , and the electron density. In practice, U is usually calculated using the bulk density instead of the electron density. U is a volumetric quantity, whereas Pe is not. U is more useful in log interpretation since it can be used in a linear mixing law in terms of the volumes of the formation components.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/volumetric_cross_section
virgin zone,The part of the formation that has not been affected by invasion.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/virgin_zone
water saturation,"The fraction of water in a given pore space. It is expressed in volume/volume, percent or saturation units. Unless otherwise stated, water saturation is the fraction of formation water in the undisturbed zone. The saturation is known as the total water saturation if the pore space is the total porosity, but is known as effective water saturation if the pore space is the effective porosity. If used without qualification, the term usually refers to the effective water saturation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/water_saturation
wait time,"The time allotted for the alignment of protons with the static magnetic field during a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement. The term is used more generally with reference to logging tools, and is synonymous with the more general term polarization time.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wait_time
wall cake,"The residue deposited on a permeable medium when a slurry, such as a drilling fluid, is forced against the medium under a pressure. Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filter-cake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filter cake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filter cake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wall_cake
water-wet,"Pertaining to the adhesion of a liquid to the surface of a solid. In water-wet conditions, a thin film of water coats the surface of the formation matrix, a condition that is desirable for efficient oil transport. Treatments that change the wettability of the formation from water-wet to oil-wet can significantly impair productivity.",Adjective,"Well Completions, Enhanced Oil Recovery",https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/water-wet
water-filled resistivity,"The resistivity of a sample completely filled with water. Called Ro, it is used in contrast to the resistivity of a sample only partially filled with water, Rt. The ratio Rt / Ro is called the resistivity index, I.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/water-filled_resistivity
weak point,"A piece of steel cable placed inside a logging head that is designed to break at a predetermined tension. If the logging tool becomes stuck in the borehole, there is a danger that the logging cable will break at surface, since this is the place of maximum tension. It is difficult to fish a long length of tangled cable in the borehole. The weak point is designed to break before the cable, so that the latter can be retrieved, leaving only the logging tool and head in the borehole.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/weak_point
whole core,"A complete section of a conventionally drilled core. The section may be up to about 2 feet [0.6 m] in length, with typical core diameters lying between 1.75 and 5.25 in. [4.4 and 13.3 cm]. The term full-diameter core is also used, but generally refers to shorter sections of about 6 in. [15 cm]. The advantage of whole core analysis is that it measures properties on a larger scale, closer to that of the reservoir. This is particularly important for heterogeneous formations such as many carbonates or fractured materials.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/whole_core
wireline log,"A continuous measurement of formation properties with electrically powered instruments to infer properties and make decisions about drilling and production operations. The record of the measurements, typically a long strip of paper, is also called a log. Measurements include",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wireline_log
wettability,"The preference of a solid to contact one liquid or gas, known as the wetting phase, rather than another. The wetting phase will tend to spread on the solid surface and a porous solid will tend to imbibe the wetting phase, in both cases displacing the nonwetting phase. Rocks can be water-wet, oil-wet or intermediate-wet. The intermediate state between water-wet and oil-wet can be caused by a mixed-wet system, in which some surfaces or grains are water-wet and others are oil-wet, or a neutral-wet system, in which the surfaces are not strongly wet by either water or oil. Both water and oil wet most materials in preference to gas, but gas can wet sulfur, graphite and coal. Wettability affects relative permeability, electrical properties, nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation times and saturation profiles in the reservoir. The wetting state impacts waterflooding and aquifer encroachment into a reservoir. Reservoir wetting preference can be determined by measuring the contact angle of crude oil and formation water on silica or calcite crystals or by measuring the characteristics of core plugs in either an Amott imbibition test or a USBM test.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wettability
wet-clay porosity,"The proportion of a wet clay that is clay-bound water. A formation that has 100% clay would have a porosity equal to the wet-clay porosity (WCLP), all of it being clay-bound water, and a volume of dry clay equal to (1 - WCLP). The concept is used to relate the volume of clay-bound water, CBW, to the volume of dry clay, Vdcl, in an actual rock, since the ratio of the two is the same and equal to:",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wet-clay_porosity
well log,"The measurement versus depth or time, or both, of one or more physical quantities in or around a well. The term comes from the word ""log"" used in the sense of a record or a note. Wireline logs are taken downhole, transmitted through a wireline to surface and recorded there. Measurements-while-drilling (MWD) and logging while drilling (LWD) logs are also taken downhole. They are either transmitted to surface by mud pulses, or else recorded downhole and retrieved later when the instrument is brought to surface. Mud logs that describe samples of drilled cuttings are taken and recorded on surface.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_log
X-ray diffraction,"A technique for the semiquantitative mineralogical analysis of a sample of rock by measuring the diffraction peaks in X-rays diffracted by the sample. The position of the diffraction peaks is a measure of the distance between discrete crystallographic diffracting planes within minerals, while their intensity indicates the quantity of the mineral. The technique is only semiquantitative because the size and shape of the diffraction peak are strongly influenced by the geometry of the measurement, for example orientation of the minerals, and sample preparation. Fine particles such as clays must be separated from larger particles and measured separately if they are to be detected properly. To reduce errors associated with preferred orientation of minerals, samples are most commonly ground to a powder before analysis, a technique known as powder X-ray diffraction.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/x/x-ray_diffraction
X-signal,"The reactive (X) signal, or that part of the alternating signal at the receiver of an induction logging tool that is out of phase with the transmitter current. This signal, also known as the quadrature signal, is less sensitive to formation conductivity and must be separated from the R-signal, which is the main or, in older tools, the only source of the induction log. In a simple two-coil array, a large component of the X-signal is caused by direct coupling between transmitter and receiver coils. This direct signal is largely eliminated by use of a bucking coil. The X-signal provides a first-order correction to the skin effect of the R-signal.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/x/x-signal
X-ray fluorescence (XRF),"A technique for elemental analysis of samples based on the characteristic fluorescence given off by different elements subjected to X-rays. In core analysis, X-ray fluorescence often is used to help determine mineral content. The elemental volumes are inverted to mineral volumes by assuming certain standard formulae for mineral composition.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/x/x-ray_fluorescence_xrf
X-radiography,A technique for imaging a core by moving a source of X-rays along a core and recording the attenuated X-rays on the other side on a suitable photographic film.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/x/x-radiography
Archie equation,"A particular relation proposed by G.E. Archie between the formation factor (F) and porosity (phi), in which F = 1 / phim, where the porosity exponent, m, is a constant for a particular formation or type of rock. In the original work, Archie proposed that m lay between 1.8 and 2.0 for consolidated sandstones, and close to 1.3 for loosely consolidated sandstones. m was named the cementation exponent shortly afterwards. This relation is also known as the Archie II equation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/archie_equation
API unit,"The unit of radioactivity used for natural gamma ray logs. This unit is based on an artificially radioactive concrete block at the University of Houston, Texas, USA, that is defined to have a radioactivity of 200 American Petroleum Institute (API) units. This was chosen because it was considered to be twice the radioactivity of a typical shale. The formation is the primary standard for calibrating gamma ray logs. However, even when properly calibrated, different gamma ray tools will not necessarily have identical readings downhole because their detectors can have different spectral sensitivities. They will read the same only if the downhole formation contains the same proportions of thorium, potassium and uranium as the Houston standard. For example, logging while drilling (LWD) tools have thicker housings than wireline tools, causing a different spectral response to the three sources of radioactivity, and therefore a different total gamma ray reading in some formations.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/api_unit
Archie rock,"A rock whose petrophysical properties are well described by the Archie equation with constant values for the porosity exponent and the saturation exponent. Such rocks typically have very little clay, a regular pore structure, and high-salinity water. The term often is used to describe a rock that is petrophysically simple.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/archie_rock
annulus,"The space between two concentric objects, such as between the wellbore and casing or between casing and tubing, where fluid can flow. Pipe may consist of drill collars, drillpipe, casing, or tubing.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/annulus
azimuthal resolution,"An angle that characterizes the ability of an azimuthal logging measurement to resolve changes in different directions around the tool; alternatively, the smallest angle for which a significant change can be detected.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/azimuthal_resolution
adjacent bed,"A formation layer above or below the layer being measured by a logging tool. The term ""surrounding bed"" is used in particular to describe the adjacent layers above or below a horizontal well. In a vertical well, the term ""shoulder bed"" is more common, and is used in particular in resistivity logging to describe the layers above and below a reservoir. The term ""adjacent bed"" is used in both cases.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/adjacent_bed
activation log,"A log of elemental concentrations derived from the characteristic energy levels of gamma rays emitted by a nucleus that has been activated by neutron bombardment. The carbon-oxygen log, elemental capture spectroscopy log, pulsed neutron spectroscopy log, aluminum activation log and oxygen activation log are all examples of activation logs. However, the term is most commonly used to refer to the aluminum and oxygen activation logs, the latter also being known as a water-flow log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/activation_log
Alford rotation,"A processing technique to project formation shear data recorded in any two orthogonal directions into the fast and slow shear directions in the presence of shear-wave anisotropy. In the sonic logging application, a dipole transmitter excites a flexural mode that is recorded at one set of receivers that is in-line with the dipole and other receivers that are 90o out of line (the cross-dipole component). A similar recording is made of the wave from a second dipole transmitter, mounted orthogonally to the first. The flexural-wave velocity is closely related to the formation shear velocity, particularly at low frequencies and in hard formations. Using all four waveforms, the Alford rotation is used to determine the speed and direction of the fast and the slow shear wave.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/alford_rotation
alpha processing,"A technique for combining a measurement that has a high accuracy but low precision with another measurement of the same quantity that has a high precision but low accuracy in order to produce a result that is better than either alone. Alpha processing is used to improve the vertical resolution of neutron porosity and other dual-detector nuclear logs. The detector near the source has better precision than the far detector in the sense that it responds more precisely to vertical changes. However, the near detector is less accurate because it is more affected by the borehole environment. Alpha processing mathematically superimposes the rapid changes of the near detector on the slowly changing but accurate far detector to produce an accurate log with high vertical resolution. The technique is also used to improve results from the carbon-oxygen log and other pulsed neutron spectroscopy measurements. Two methods are used to determine the carbon/oxygen ratio. The windows method counts the number of gamma rays within energy windows placed at the main peaks for carbon and oxygen. This method has good statistical precision but poor accuracy, as gamma rays from other elements contaminate these windows. The other method, spectral stripping, compares the total spectrum against standards for many elements, inverting the spectrum to obtain the yield for each element. This method is more accurate but has less statistical precision. Averaging over a number of measurements, alpha processing adjusts the windows result with the more accurate spectral stripping in order to obtain a precise and accurate result.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/alpha_processing
altered zone,"A near-wellbore formation zone, a few inches thick, whose acoustic velocity has been affected by impregnation with drilling fluids, stress relief, or both. The acoustic velocity of the rock in the immediate vicinity of the borehole wall can be much slower than that in the virgin formation. To measure the formation velocity, it may be necessary to use a sonic logging tool that has a greater spacing between transmitter and receiver array (about 10 to 15 ft [3 to 4.5 m]) than the standard sonic tool (about 3 to 5 ft [0.9 to 1.5 m]). The altered zone may also give rise to different acoustic modes, for example the hybrid mode or a second Stoneley wave.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/altered_zone
aluminum activation log,"A wireline log of the concentration by weight of aluminum in the formation, based on the principle of neutron activation. Aluminum (27Al) can be activated by capturing relatively low-energy neutrons from a chemical source to produce the isotope 28Al, which decays with a half-life of 2.3 minutes and emits a relatively easily detected 1.78 MeV gamma ray. A natural gamma ray spectrometer will detect this gamma ray along with the other natural gamma rays. If the natural gamma spectrum has been measured before activation, it can be subtracted from the spectrum after activation to give an estimate of Al content. Al is a relatively direct indicator of the volume of clay, since clay minerals are alumino-silicates.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/aluminum_activation_log
accelerator source,"A device for producing high-energy neutrons by using a charged particle accelerator. Neutron generators are used in various pulsed neutron devices and some neutron porosity measurements. In a typical device, deuterium (2D) and tritium (3T) ions are accelerated towards a target also containing the same isotopes. When 2D and 3T collide, they react to produce a neutron with an energy of about 14.1 MeV. The first neutron generators were built in the late 1950s and soon led to the first pulsed neutron capture log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/accelerator_source
acoustic mode,"A situation in which acoustic energy that propagates in one direction is confined in the other two directions as, for example, a mode confined to an interface between two different materials or within the borehole. The Stoneley wave, tube wave and flexural mode have important applications in formation evaluation, while most of the others, such as the Rayleigh wave and the various guided borehole modes (normal mode, leaky mode and hybrid mode), are considered interference that must be filtered out. In y slow formations, leaky modes can help determine formation compressional slowness.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/acoustic_mode
array propagation resistivity,"A resistivity recorded by a measurements-while-drilling propagation tool consisting of an array of transmitters and receivers whose signals are recorded separately and combined by software to produce the response desired. In a typical design, five transmitters emit a signal, and the phase shift and attenuation between two receivers are recorded. The phase shifts and attenuations are combined in different ways to produce borehole-compensated logs with different depths of investigation and radial resolution.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/array_propagation_resistivity
array induction,"An induction tool or log that consists of several mutually balanced arrays whose signals are recorded separately and combined in software to produce the response desired. Typically, there is one transmitter and five to ten pairs of receivers and bucking coils that are balanced to remove direct coupling. The signals are combined in a wide variety of ways to produce the responses desired, as for example, deep-reading, high vertical resolution or some combination of both. There are trade-offs in any response. For example, a deep-reading log typically will not have high vertical resolution. If it does, it will be more sensitive to the invasion condition and cave effect.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/array_induction
armor,"The metal strands on the outside of a wireline logging cable. Typical cables have two layers of metal strands, one wound clockwise and the other counterclockwise. The armor gives the cable its strength. It is used as the current return in some electrical measurements.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/armor
azimuthal density,"A type of logging while drilling density log in which the density is measured at different azimuths around the drill collar. The density measurement is focused so that when the collar rotates, the measurement sees different azimuths around the borehole. An average density can be calculated by summing all the azimuthal data. Alternatively, the data can be summed over different segments, for example in four quadrants, to give an azimuthal density in four directions. When the hole is overgauge, certain quadrants will be firmly pressed against the borehole wall, while others may have a significant standoff and too high a delta rho. The good quadrants can then be chosen for formation evaluation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/azimuthal_density
attenuation resistivity,"The ability of a formation to resist electrical conduction, as derived from the reduction in amplitude of the electromagnetic wave generated in a propagation resistivity measurement. At the frequencies used and within the range of measurement, the attenuation depends almost solely on the resistivity, so that the former can be transformed to the latter with a simple algorithm. The transform also depends on transmitter/receiver spacings and tool design. For a 2-MHz measurement, a typical measurement range is 0.2 to 50 ohm.m. Above 50 ohm.m, the dependence of attenuation on resistivity is too small to measure accurately.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/attenuation_resistivity
azimuthal laterolog,"A type of electrode device that is able to measure resistivity in different directions around the sonde. In most laterologs, the electrodes are cylinders that average the resistivity azimuthally around the sonde. In azimuthal laterologs, the electrode is segmented radially in several portions, each of which responds to the resistivity in the direction it is facing.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/azimuthal_laterolog
array laterolog,"An electrode device with multiple current electrodes configured in several different ways to produce several different responses. A typical array consists of a central electrode emitting survey current, with multiple guard electrodes above and below it. Current is sent between different guard electrodes to achieve greater or less focusing. The greater the focusing, the greater the depth of investigation. About five basic measurements are obtained in this way. This hardware focusing may be further improved by software focusing, in which the signals from the basic measurements are superimposed mathematically to ensure proper focusing in a wide range of conditions.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/array_laterolog
array sonic,"A type of acoustic logging tool that uses a large number of receivers, typically 4 to 12. Modern acoustic logging tools are designed to measure not only the compressional wave but also the shear and other acoustic waves generated by the transmitter. The separation and identification of these waves are facilitated by the use of an array of receivers placed about 6 in [15 cm] apart, which is close enough to avoid aliasing but far enough to sample a significant moveout in the wave. The waveforms at each receiver are recorded and processed by signal processing techniques, such as slowness-time coherence, to measure the velocities of the different waves.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/array_sonic
azimuthal,"Pertaining to being focused in one direction. An azimuthal, or azimuthally focused, measurement has one or more directions perpendicular to the surface of a logging tool from which it receives most of its signal. Examples are the density, laterolog and microresistivity logs. A nonazimuthal, or azimuthally symmetric measurement is one which measures equally in all directions around the tool. Examples are the induction, propagation resistivity log, and gamma ray.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/azimuthal
accuracy,"The closeness of the agreement between the result of the measurement and the conventional true value of the quantity. Accuracy should not be confused with precision. (ISO) Core measurements have well-defined calibration techniques and standards. Logging measurements are characterized during tool design and construction, and calibrated regularly to some standard. The quoted accuracy of a log then depends on the initial characterization, the reproducibility of the standard, and the stability of the measurement between calibrations and under downhole conditions. The actual accuracy also depends on the equipment performing and being operated to specification.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/accuracy
attenuation,"The loss of energy or amplitude of waves as they pass through media. Seismic waves lose energy through absorption, reflection, and refraction at interfaces; mode conversion and spherical divergence; or spreading of the wave.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/attenuation
acid effect,"The change in a pulsed neutron capture measurement produced by acidizing a carbonate formation. Acidizing tends to increase the porosity as well as leave chlorides in the formation, thereby increasing the capture cross section. Both of these results affect the formation thermal decay time and must be taken into account in the interpretation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/acid_effect
acquisition log,"The log that is actually recorded while taking the measurements. It is distinct from a playback, which is produced later on from digital data.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/acquisition_log
acoustic log,A display of traveltime of acoustic waves versus depth in a well. The term is commonly used as a synonym for a sonic log. Some acoustic logs display velocity.,Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/acoustic_log
apparent matrix,"A calculation of the properties of the solid fraction of a rock from the combination of two logs. For example, by combining the density and neutron porosity measurements, it is possible to compute an apparent matrix density; by combining neutron porosity and sonic measurement, it is possible to compute an apparent matrix traveltime. The computations assume a particular fluid, usually fresh water, and particular response equations. The results are often displayed as quicklook logs for lithology identification. The word matrix is used here in the formation evaluation sense of the term rather than the geological one.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/apparent_matrix
a,"The value a in the relation of formation factor (F) to porosity (phi): F = a/ phim. The value a is derived empirically from best fits of measured values of F and phi on a group of rock samples. It has no clear physical significance, although it has been related to grain shape and tortuosity. In the saturation equation, it always occurs associated with the water resistivity as (a * Rw). It is sometimes claimed that a must be 1 because at phi = 1, F must be 1. However, a material with phi = 1 is not a rock: a is essentially an empirical factor for rocks and as such can take any value. A wide range of values has been found, from 0.5 to 5.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/a
acoustic transducer,"A device for transforming electrical energy into sound, or vice versa. In sonic logging applications, acoustic transducers are usually made of piezoelectric ceramic or magnetostrictive materials, and may be used as either receivers or transmitters in a frequency range between about 1 and 30 kHz. The transducers are excited as either monopoles, emitting or receiving sound in all directions, or dipoles, emitting or receiving in one plane. In ultrasonic logging applications, acoustic transducers are made of piezoelectric ceramic materials, and often are used in alternating transmitter/receiver (pulse-echo) mode, in a frequency range from a few hundred kilohertz to a few megahertz.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/acoustic_transducer
antisqueeze,"The effect on a laterolog whereby the current lines are no longer properly focused but spread out at a certain distance into the formation. The effect occurs opposite a high-resistivity bed with low-resistivity shoulders. The result is that laterolog devices, in particular deep devices, tend to read too low and have less depth of investigation. Shoulder bed correction charts correct for these effects in certain well-defined situations, such as no invasion in horizontal beds with vertical wells.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/antisqueeze
sidewall core,"A core taken from the side of the borehole, usually by a wireline tool. Sidewall cores may be taken using percussion or mechanical drilling. Percussion cores are taken by firing hollow bullets into the formation. The bullets are attached to the tool by fasteners, and are retrieved, along with the core inside, by pulling up the tool and the fasteners. Percussion coring tools typically hold 20 to 30 bullets, but two or three tools can be combined on one run in the hole. Mechanical tools use hollow rotary drills to cut and then pull out core plugs. Up to 75 plugs can be recovered on one run. With full recovery, cores from typical percussion tools are 1 in. [2.5 cm] in diameter by 1 3/4 in. [4.4 cm] long, while those from mechanical tools are 0.91 in. [2.3 cm] in diameter by 2 in. [5 cm] long. The latter are also known as rotary sidewall cores.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sidewall_core
sidewall,"Relating to being held against, or taken from, the side of the borehole. The term also describes a measurement that must be made by pressing the sonde against the side of the borehole in order to minimize borehole effects, as, for example, a sidewall epithermal neutron log.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sidewall
sigma,"The macroscopic cross section for the absorption of thermal neutrons, or capture cross section, of a volume of matter, measured in capture units (c.u.). Sigma is also used as an adjective to refer to a log of this quantity. Sigma is the principal output of the pulsed neutron capture log, which is mainly used to determine water saturation behind casing. Thermal neutrons have about the same energy as that of the surrounding matter, typically less than 0.4 eV.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sigma
sieve analysis,"The process of analyzing the size distribution of a sand or gravel sample. In sand-control applications, a sample of formation sand is shaken through a series of sieves of known size. The resulting distribution is then used to design an appropriate treatment that will retain the sand, while causing a minimal restriction to production.",Noun,Well Completions,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sieve_analysis
shoulder bed,"A formation layer above or below the layer being measured by a logging tool. The term is used in particular in resistivity logging to describe the layers above and below a reservoir. Some resistivity tools, such as induction and laterolog devices, can sense beds located tens of feet from the measure point and can be significantly affected by shoulder beds even when the reservoir is thick. The term is more commonly used for vertical wells, and is derived from the typical picture of resistivity log response across a reservoir: a high resistivity reservoir (the head) with two low-resistivity shales above and below (the shoulders). The term also may be used in horizontal wells, although in that context the term surrounding bed is more common. The term adjacent bed is used in both cases.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shoulder_bed
secondary porosity index,"An indicator of the porosity that does not contribute to a sonic measurement of interval transit time. The transit time is little affected by vugs, fractures and other irregular events because the sonic wave finds a faster path around them. Spherical pores such as oomolds also have less effect on traveltime than oblate pores. Thus, when the sonic porosity is less than some measurement of the total porosity, the difference can be attributed to the presence of post-depositional, or secondary, porosity. The sonic porosity is usually derived from the Wyllie time-average equation, or some other suitable transform, and the total porosity taken as the density-neutron crossplot porosity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/secondary_porosity_index
structural shale,"A particular type of shale distribution in which the shale exists as grains within a rock framework, in contrast to dispersed shale and laminar shale. The term also refers to a formation model or saturation equation based on this distribution.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/structural_shale
stress-induced anisotropy,"A situation in which the formation shear-wave velocity varies azimuthally around the borehole, because unequal stresses in the formation have caused azimuthal variations in the stress concentrations around the borehole. These stress concentrations change the shear-wave speeds in the region surrounding the well from those in the far field, such that a characteristic response is observed in the dispersion of the dipole flexural mode.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stress-induced_anisotropy
stick/slip,"The irregular movement of a logging tool up a well due to it being stuck at some point and then being released. In normal operation, the cable is pulled smoothly out of the well and the logging tool follows. However, the tool can become stuck by differential pressure or an irregular hole. The cable stretches, and its tension increases, until the tool is freed. At this point it moves, or slips, quickly up the hole until the normal movement is resumed. Since the depth measurement is driven by the cable, the log readings opposite a zone of stick/slip are displayed at incorrect depths. Furthermore, since each measurement has a different measure point, the zone of stick/slip shows up at a different depth on each measurement.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stick_and_slip
step profile,"With reference to invasion, an abrupt change from the flushed zone to the undisturbed zone, with no transition zone or annulus. This simple model is used most commonly in connection with older resistivity logs since it allows the invasion to be represented by three parameters: flushed-zone resistivity, undisturbed-zone resistivity and diameter of invasion. The model assumes equal invasion at all azimuths. Newer array logs allow more complex invasion models to be interpreted.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/step_profile
systematic error,"A reproducible inaccuracy of measurement introduced by either faulty design, failing equipment, inadequate calibration, inferior procedure or a change in the measurement environment.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/systematic_error
Stoneley permeability,"The ability of fluid to move through a rock, as measured by the reduction in amplitude or increase in slowness of the acoustic Stoneley wave generated in the borehole. The velocity and amplitude of the Stoneley wave are reduced by the presence of mobile fluids in the formation. Physically, the effect can be seen as a coupling of the Stoneley energy into a formation wave known as the slow wave, as predicted by the Biot theory. The amount of reduction is a complicated function of this mobility (or permeability divided by viscosity), the properties of the borehole fluid, the pore fluid and the mudcake, the elastic properties of the rock and the frequency. Since all these factors are measured or estimated from logs, it is possible to determine formation mobility. In practice, the mobility needs to be reasonably high for the method to be accurate.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stoneley_permeability
survey,"A dataset measured and recorded with reference to a particular area of the Earth's surface, such as a seismic survey.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/survey
surrounding bed,"A formation layer above or below the layer being measured by a logging tool. The term is used in particular to describe the adjacent layers above or below a horizontal well. In a vertical well, the term shoulder bed is more common. The term adjacent bed is used in both cases.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/surrounding_bed
Soxhlet extractor,"An apparatus for cleaning core samples using the distillation extraction method. In the Soxhlet apparatus (also called extractor, or chamber), the sample soaks in hot solvent that is periodically siphoned off, distilled and returned to the sample. The process continues until the siphoned-off solvent becomes clear. In the Soxhlet apparatus, the sample soaks in the solvent, while in the Dean-Stark apparatus, the solvent flows through the sample from top to bottom.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/soxhlet_extractor
SP,One of a number of locations or stations at the surface of the Earth at which a seismic source is activated.,Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sp
summation of fluids method,"A technique for measuring the effective porosity of a core sample by summing the volumes of the fluids recovered from it. The volumes of the gas, oil and water in the sample usually are determined by the retort method, which also determines the bulk volume. The porosity is then the ratio of the total fluid volume to the bulk volume.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/summation_of_fluids_method
SOR,"Abbreviation for residual oil saturation. Fraction of pore volume occupied by oil at the end of oil displacement that used a specific fluid. This reservoir engineering quantity signifies the ultimate recovery under a given displacement process and represents the endpoint of the relative permeability curves in reservoir simulation. The residual oil saturation quantity is the saturation achieved after an infinite number of pore volumes of the displacing fluid have flowed through a particular portion of reservoir rock. To define residual oil saturation, the displacement method and the type, volume, direction and velocity of the displacing fluid must be known. Residual oil saturation is the ratio of the immobile residual oil volume divided by the effective porosity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sor
spectrum,"Generally, a display of entities or properties according to magnitude. In geophysics, spectrum refers to a display of characteristics of a wavetrain or trace as a function of frequency, wavenumber, or arrival time. A common display of spectrum is amplitude as a function of frequency.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spectrum
shifted spectrum,"A technique in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging based on the shift in the T2 distributions, or spectra, acquired with different echo spacings. The technique is usually used to detect gas or light oil. These fluids have a significant diffusion relaxation. A measurement made with a standard short echo spacing will give a signal from these fluids at a certain T2. A measurement made with a long echo spacing will cause more diffusion relaxation and a shorter T2. Other fluids, with minor contribution from diffusion, will not be changed. Gas and light oil can therefore be identified by the shift between the two T2 distributions.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shifted_spectrum
slowing-down length,"A parameter used to characterize neutron interactions in bulk material above the thermal region. The slowing-down length (Ls) is proportional to the root-mean-square distance from the point of emission of a high-energy neutron to the point at which its energy has decreased to the lower edge of the epithermal energy region. The slowing-down length is the physical parameter that best describes the response of an epithermal neutron porosity measurement, and describes a large part of the response of a thermal neutron porosity measurement. Thermal neutrons have about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically less than about 0.4 eV, while epithermal neutrons have higher energy, between about 0.4 and 10 eV.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/slowing-down_length
slow formation,"A formation in which the velocity of the compressional wave traveling through the borehole fluid is greater than the velocity of the shear wave through the surrounding formation. In such conditions, there is no critical refraction of the shear wave and no shear head wave generated, so that standard techniques based on monopole transducers cannot be used to measure formation shear velocity. Instead, it is necessary to use dipole sources to excite the flexural mode. The velocity of the latter is closely related to that of the shear wave. In very slow formations, such as in high-porosity gas sands, the formation compressional velocity also may be less than the borehole fluid velocity, causing no compressional head wave. In such cases, it is possible to estimate the formation compressional velocity from the low-frequency end of a leaky mode.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/slow_formation
slowness,"Also called interval transit time, the amount of time for a wave to travel a certain distance, proportional to the reciprocal of velocity, typically measured in microseconds per foot by an acoustic log and symbolized by t or DT. P-wave interval transit times for common sedimentary rock types range from 43 (dolostone) to 160 (unconsolidated shales) microseconds per foot, and can be distinguished from measurements of steel casing, which has a consistent transit time of 57 microseconds per foot.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/slowness
slowing-down time,"With reference to pulsed neutron logging, the characteristic time for the decay of the epithermal neutron population. The slowing-down time of a formation is strongly dependent on the porosity. In openhole pulsed neutron logging, it is also dependent on the standoff between tool and borehole wall. Epithermal neutrons have energies above that of the surrounding matter, between about 0.4 eV and 10 eV.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/slowing-down_time
slowness time coherence,"A technique used for identifying and measuring the slowness and time of arrival of coherent acoustic energy propagating across an array of receivers. The different packets of coherent energy can then be identified in terms of their origin, for example compressional, shear, Stoneley or other arrivals. In formation evaluation slowness-time coherence is used in conjunction with an array-sonic tool in which the full waveforms at each receiver have been recorded. The technique consists in passing a narrow window across the waveforms and measuring the coherence within the window for a wide range of slownesses and times of arrival.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/slowness_time_coherence
small-pore water,"Water in microporosity or other small pores. The term usually refers to the nuclear magnetic resonance signal of such water, which occurs at very short times and overlaps the signal from clay-bound water.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/small-pore_water
saturation unit,A unit equal to the percentage of a given fluid in the total volume of a pore space. The term is abbreviated to s.u. and lies between 0 and 100.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/saturation_unit
scintillation detector,"A device for measuring the number and energy of gamma rays. The device consists of a crystal and a photomultiplier. In the crystal, an incident gamma ray imparts energy to electrons through Compton scattering, photoelectric absorption and pair production. The electrons excite the detector crystal lattice. Crystal de-excitation emits visible or near-visible light, the scintillation, which is detected by the photomultiplier and transformed into an electrical pulse. The frequency and amplitude of the electric pulse are related to the number of gamma rays and their respective energy levels, and are recorded in a log. Scintillation detectors are used in all natural gamma ray, induced gamma ray and density logging devices.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/scintillation_detector
skin effect,"The loss in amplitude and change in phase of an electromagnetic field as it penetrates into a conductive medium. In an induction log, the skin effect causes a reduction of the R-signal (in-phase) and an increase in the X-signal (out-of-phase) at the receiver. It has a significant effect on the 6FF40 array, particularly below 1 ohm-m. Since the magnitude of the reduction depends on the conductivity, the skin effect can be corrected for by using a fixed function of the measured conductivity. A much improved method is to estimate the correction from the X-signal measured in balanced arrays.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/skin_effect
shale baseline,"The average reading of the spontaneous potential (SP) log opposite the shale layers in a well. Opposite shales, the SP is relatively constant and changes only slowly with depth. This is the shale baseline. The log is normally adjusted by the logging engineer to read near zero at the baseline. Sharp shifts in the baseline can sometimes be observed, for example when two permeable beds with different formation water salinities are separated by a shale that is not a perfect cationic membrane, or when the formation water salinity changes within a permeable bed.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shale_baseline
saturation equation,"An equation for calculating the water saturation from resistivity and other logs. There are many saturation equations. Practical equations are all extensions of the Archie equation, which is valid for a rock with very little clay, or very high salinity water, and with a regular pore structure. The majority deal with the problem of shaly sands, and can be divided into two main groups?those that treat the shale as a volume of conductive material (Vsh models), and those that analyze the effect of clay counter-ions. Vsh models take many forms. Typical examples are the Simandoux, laminated sand and Indonesian equations. The other group includes the Waxman-Smits, Dual Water and SGS equations. Most nonshaly sand equations deal with the problem of mixed pore types, for example combinations of fractures, isolated pores and intergranular pores.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/saturation_equation
saturation exponent,"The exponent, n, in the relation of water saturation, Sw, to resistivity index, I (I = Sw-n) for a sample of rock. It expresses the effect on the resistivity of desaturating the sample, or replacing water with a non-conductive fluid. In petrophysically simple, water-wet rocks (Archie rocks), n is constant for different values of Sw, and a single average n can be found for a particular reservoir or formation. A typical value is 2. In more complex rocks, n changes with Sw, although often being about 2 near Sw = 1. In rocks with conductive minerals, such as shaly sands, n becomes increasingly lower as Sw is reduced. This change is negligible for high-salinity waters, but increases as the salinity is reduced. In shaly-sand saturation equations, such as Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS and CRMM, n is the intrinsic n, determined with high-salinity water or with the clay effects removed. The variation of I with Sw is then predicted, with varying success, by the different equations. In carbonates with multiple pore types, such as fractures, vugs, interparticle porosity and microporosity, n may change as each pore type is desaturated. A different n may be used for a different range of Sw. In all cases, n increases if any pores are oil-wet. Values up to 8 have been reported in very oil-wet rocks.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/saturation_exponent
sampling error,The error introduced by the sampling process caused by making measurements on only a limited portion of a formation.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sampling_error
sampling interval,"The depth or time between successive measurements by a sensor. For measurements-while-drilling (MWD) logs, the sampling interval is most commonly a time. For wireline measurements, it is most commonly a depth.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sampling_interval
sandstone porosity unit,"A transform from raw log data chosen so that a log recorded in these units will give the correct porosity of the formation providing the matrix is pure quartz and the pores are filled with fresh water. The unit, which may be in vol/vol or p.u., is most commonly used for neutron porosity logs but may also be used for density and acoustic logs. The definition is strictly true only if all borehole and other environmental corrections have been applied.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sandstone_porosity_unit
sonic measurement,"A technique for recording the formation compressional slowness based on the transit time between transmitter and receiver. In the most basic wireline sonic measurement, an acoustic transducer emits a sonic signal, of between about 10 and 30 kHz, which is detected at two receivers farther up the hole. The time between emission and reception is measured for each receiver, and subtracted to give the traveltime in the interval between the two receivers. If the receivers are two feet apart, then this time is divided by two to give the interval transit time, or slowness, of the formation. This type of measurement is also known as first motion detection. This technique works because the first arrival at the receiver is a wave that has traveled from the transmitter to the borehole wall, where it has generated a compressional wave in the formation. Some of this wave is critically refracted up the borehole wall, generating head waves in the borehole fluid as it progresses. Some of these strike the receiver, arriving in most cases well before any signal traveling directly through the mud. Furthermore, if the logging tool is parallel to the borehole wall, the traveltime in the mud is cancelled by taking the difference between the traveltime to the two receivers. Problems of irregular hole or a tilted tool are avoided by using borehole compensation. The depth of investigation depends on the slowness, the transmitter-to-receiver spacing and the presence or absence of an altered zone. It is generally within the invaded zone, and of the order of several inches.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sonic_measurement
spine and ribs plot,"For a two-detector density tool, the plot of long-spacing versus short-spacing count rates for different formation densities, mudcake densities and mudcake thicknesses. The plot takes its name from the spine, which is the locus of points with no mudcake, and the ribs, which show the effect of mudcake at certain fixed formation densities. The plot illustrates graphically that for a given formation density there is only one rib for all normal mudcake densities and thicknesses. Thus, although there are three unknowns, it is possible to make a correction using two measurements.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spine_and_ribs_plot
spherical focusing,"A technique for focusing an electrode device based on maintaining a spherical equipotential surface centered at the main current electrode. Unlike the laterolog, which tries to maintain equipotential lines parallel to the sonde, spherical focusing tries to maintain the spherical equipotential lines that would exist in a homogeneous formation with no borehole. This is achieved with a particular arrangement of current-emitting electrode, current-return electrodes and monitor electrodes. This arrangement creates two spherical equipotential spheres with a constant voltage drop between them. The resistivity is determined from the current flowing between the spheres and the voltage drop. The depth of investigation is determined by the radii of the two spheres. Spherical focusing is used to produce shallow-reading resistivity logs and the pad-based microspherical log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spherical_focusing
specific permeability,"The permeability of a porous medium to a specific fluid, when that fluid is the only fluid present. Permeability is defined as a property of the porous medium. However, the permeability measured on samples often depends on the fluid used. For example, liquids can affect the permeability through fines movement and clay alteration; gas permeability depends on slippage and inertial resistance, unless fully corrected for these effects. It is therefore more correct to talk of specific permeability to a particular fluid, although, in practice, the shorter term, permeability, is common.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/specific_permeability
sonde error,"The measurement of an induction tool in a nonconducting medium before correction. Electronic offsets and coupling within the tool cause a signal in the receivers even in a nonconducting medium such as air. This signal is cancelled either electronically or in software. Sonde errors change with temperature and pressure downhole. This can be allowed for by characterizing the sonde's response to temperature and pressure on the surface. Sonde error is measured by placing the tool far from the ground in air. Ideally measurements are made at two distances, since the ground signal can then be determined from the difference and eliminated. Originally, sonde error referred only to the R-signal, since this was the only signal being used. The term now refers to both R- and X-signals.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sonde_error
sonde,"The section of a logging tool that contains the measurement sensors, as distinct from the cartridge, which contains the electronics and power supplies.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sonde
static spontaneous potential,"The ideal spontaneous potential (SP) that would be observed opposite a permeable bed if the SP currents were prevented from flowing and any shaliness in the bed were ignored. The static spontaneous potential (SSP) is equal to the electrochemical potential. When current is flowing, the SP measures only that fraction of the potential drop that occurs in the borehole. In normal conditions, this potential drop is much higher than the drop in the formation because the cross-sectional area of the borehole is much smaller, and hence its resistance much higher. It is for this reason that in the middle of a thick, clean bed whose resistivity is not too high, the SP reads close to the SSP. However, in other conditions the SP is significantly less than the SSP. As well as ignoring shaliness in the sand, the SSP ignores other sources of potential and assumes a surrounding shale that is a perfect cationic membrane.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/static_spontaneous_potential
steady state,"A system that has reached equilibrium for the measurement or phenomenon concerned. In the case of permeability measurements on core samples, a steady state is reached when the flow rate, the upstream and the downstream pressures no longer change with time. At this point the permeability can be calculated from the flow rate and pressures and applying Darcy's equation. If gas is used, the inertial resistance and gas slippage (Klinkenberg effect) should be corrected for.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/steady_state
square log,"A log in which the changes in reading with depth only occur abruptly, with no transition. A square log is often an approximation of a real log, in which the continuously varying input log has been approximated by constant values and abrupt changes. A square log contains less data than a real log but can be useful for further processing.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/square_log
spreading loss,The additional loss in amplitude of an electromagnetic wave emitted by an electromagnetic propagation or dielectric propagation measurement compared to that of a plane wave. The spreading loss depends on the geometry of the transmitter-receiver array and also on the dielectric properties of the formation. The same effect also causes a small correction to the propagation time.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spreading_loss
spontaneous potential,"Naturally occurring (static) electrical potential in the Earth. Spontaneous potentials are usually caused by charge separation in clay or other minerals, by the presence of a semipermeable interface impeding the diffusion of ions through the pore space of rocks, or by natural flow of a conducting fluid (salty water) through the rocks. Variations in SP can be measured in the field and in wellbores to determine variations of ionic concentration in pore fluids of rocks.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spontaneous_potential
spiral borehole,"Another term for corkscrew hole, the result of certain drilling conditions that cause the borehole to take the shape of a corkscrew. Most logging tools are much longer than the wavelength of the corkscrew, and therefore see it as a change in standoff or a change in hole size. For this reason, the corkscrew is often observed as a wave on the caliper log. A corkscrew hole affects measurements sensitive to standoff, such as induction and neutron porosity, and may affect pad tools, if they cannot follow the changes.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/spiral_borehole
standoff,The space between the shaped charge and the internal surface of the perforating gun body. The standoff is generally sufficient to allow the shaped charge jet to form before exiting the gun body.,Noun,Perforating,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/standoff
SSP,A mnemonic for the static spontaneous potential.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/ssp
6FF40,"Referring to an induction log made with a particular array of transmitter and receiver coils. The array was introduced in 1960 and became the industry standard for 30 years. The 6FF40 array has six coils with the main transmitter-receiver pair spaced 40 in [102 cm] apart. The design of the array includes the spacing between the coils, the number of turns, and the polarity of each coil. The three transmitter and three receiver coils are each connected in series to produce one signal output. FF means focused both radially and vertically. Unlike in an array tool, the focusing is fixed by the hardware design.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/sym/6ff40

run,"With reference to logging, an operation in which a logging tool is lowered into a borehole and then retrieved from it while recording measurements.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/r/run
tool string,"The downhole hardware needed to make a log. Measurements-while-drilling (MWD) logging tools, in some cases known as logging while drilling (LWD) tools, are drill collars into which the necessary sensors and electronics have been built. Wireline logging tools are typically cylinders from 1.5 to 5 in. [3.8 to 12.7 cm] in diameter. Since the total length is more than can be conveniently handled in one piece, the logging tool is divided into different sections that are assembled at the wellsite. These sections consist of cartridges and sondes. Different measurements can be combined to make up a tool string. The total length of a tool string may range from 10 to 100 ft [3 to 30 m] or more. Flexible joints are added in long tool strings to ease passage in the borehole, and to allow different sections to be centralized or eccentralized. If the total length is very long, it is often preferable to make two or more logging runs with shorter tool strings.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tool_string
transmission tomography,A technique used in crosswell seismic and electromagnetic tomography for recording the direct signal from the source or transmitter in one well to the receiver array in another well. This technique is used for mapping the distribution of acoustic velocity and attenuation or electromagnetic resistivity between wells.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transmission_tomography
transverse relaxation,"The loss of coherent energy by protons in a rock while precessing about a static magnetic field during a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement. The loss of coherent energy, or relaxation, due to the free induction decay is corrected by the CPMG pulse sequence. This leaves three mechanisms for relaxation: surface relaxation, bulk relaxation and diffusion relaxation, all of which depend on formation properties. Transverse relaxation is characterized by an exponential decay of time constant T2.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transverse_relaxation
track,"A vertical section of a log presentation over which one particular set of data is displayed. The track divides the presentation into different sections, each with a certain set of log curves or other data, such as depth numbers. The section is vertical in the sense that it is along the depth or time axis of the log. The curves are usually blanked off when they run outside their allotted track. Tracks are typically numbered from left to right across the page (when viewed with depth or time increasing towards the bottom of the page).",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/track
T1,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, the characteristic time for longitudinal relaxation. In rocks, longitudinal relaxation is the inverse sum of the surface relaxation and bulk relaxation. T1 is not normally measured in NMR logging, but is an important parameter in deciding the polarization time and hence the logging speed. T1 is closely related to the transverse relaxation time, T2. The ratio T1/T2 in water-filled rocks is typically between 1.5 and 2.5. In light hydrocarbons and gas, the ratio increases up to 10 and more as the viscosity decreases.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/t1
tail,"The last page or pages on a log print, which may contain data about the well, the recording parameters and the calibration of the measurements.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tail
T2,"In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging, the characteristic time for transverse relaxation. In rocks, there are three components of the transverse relaxation: surface, Ts; bulk, Tb; and diffusion relaxation, Td. T2 is the inverse sum of each component for each fluid, as follows: 1/T2 = 1/Ts + 1/Tb + 1/Td. Because of the reciprocal sum, the smallest of the three types of relaxations is the most important in determining the final T2 for each fluid. There is not one single value of T2 for a rock but a wide distribution of values lying anywhere between fractions of a millisecond and several seconds. The distribution of T2 values is the principal output of an NMR log.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/t2
terrain correction,"The positive gravity correction that accounts for the deviation of the topography from the horizontal slab of infinite extent assumed in the Bouguer correction. Local topographic features always decrease the gravity measurement because the attractive force of the topography above the station is away from the Earth, and the effect of topography below the station is negative because of the absence of attractive material.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/terrain_correction
true resistivity,"With reference to log analysis, the resistivity of the undisturbed formation. It is derived from a resistivity log that has been corrected as far as possible for all environmental effects, such as borehole, invasion and surrounding bed effects. Hence, it is taken as the true resistivity of the undisturbed formation in situ and is called Rt.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/true_resistivity
telemetry,"A system for converting the measurements recorded by a wireline or measurements-while-drilling (MWD) tool into a suitable form for transmission to the surface. In the case of wireline logging, the measurements are converted into electronic pulses or analog signals that are sent up the cable. In the case of MWD, they are usually converted into an amplitude or frequency-modulated pattern of mud pulses. Some MWD tools use wirelines run inside the drillpipe. Others use wireless telemetry, in which signals are sent as electromagnetic waves through the Earth. Wireless telemetry is also used downhole to send signals from one part of an MWD tool to another.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/telemetry
trace,"The seismic data recorded for one channel. A trace is a recording of the Earth's response to seismic energy passing from the source, through subsurface layers, and back to the receiver.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/trace
tortuosity,"A measure of the geometric complexity of a porous medium. Tortuosity is a ratio that characterizes the convoluted pathways of fluid diffusion and electrical conduction through porous media. In the fluid mechanics of porous media, tortuosity is the ratio of the length of a streamline—a flow line or path—between two points to the straight-line distance between those points. Tortuosity is thus related to the ratio of a fluid's diffusion coefficient when it is not confined by a porous medium to its effective diffusion coefficient when confined in a porous medium. Tortuosity is also related to the formation factor, which is the ratio of electrical resistivity of a conductive fluid in a porous medium to the electrical resistivity of the fluid itself.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tortuosity
torpedo,The connection between the wireline logging cable and the bridle. The torpedo consists of an outer mechanical connection enclosing electrical connections between the conductors.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/torpedo
top log interval,"The top of the interval recorded on the log, or the shallowest point at which the log readings are valid. If the top of the log is at the casing shoe, the last valid reading of many logs will be a short distance below. However, it is common to give the depth of the casing shoe as the top log interval.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/top_log_interval
total porosity,"The total pore volume per unit volume of rock. It is measured in volume/volume, percent or porosity units. The total porosity is the total void space and as such includes isolated pores and the space occupied by clay-bound water. It is the porosity measured by core analysis techniques that involve disaggregating the sample. It is also the porosity measured by many log measurements, including density, neutron porosity and nuclear magnetic resonance logs.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/total_porosity
tornado chart,"A plot representing the effect of invasion on resistivity measurements that have different depths of investigation. The plot assumes a step-profile model of invasion and determines true resistivity, flushed zone resistivity and diameter of invasion from ratios of deep-, medium- and shallow-resistivity measurements. Strictly speaking, when both resistive invasion and conductive invasion are plotted, the chart is called a butterfly chart. When only one is plotted, it is known as a tornado chart.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tornado_chart
transition zone,"An area in which water is too shallow for acquisition of marine seismic data with towed streamers, such as near the shoreline, marshes and lagoons. In some cases, source explosives can be rammed into the unconsolidated sediments of transition zone environments rather than drilling more costly shot holes. Likewise, hydrophones can be placed by ramming to couple the receiver to the Earth better and to save time and money during survey acquisition.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/transition_zone
thermal neutron porosity measurement,"A measurement of the slowing down and capture of neutrons between a source and one or more thermal neutron detectors. The neutron source emits high-energy neutrons that are slowed mainly by elastic scattering to near thermal levels. Thermal neutrons have about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically less than 0.4 eV. The slowing-down process is dominated by hydrogen. At thermal levels, the neutrons diffuse through the material until they undergo thermal capture. Capture is dominated by chlorine, hydrogen and other thermal neutron absorbers. Typical thermal neutron measurements use a chemical neutron source and two thermal neutron detectors. An accelerator source (neutron generator) is sometimes used. Some, mainly earlier, devices measure the gamma rays emitted by thermal capture, rather than thermal neutrons.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thermal_neutron_porosity_measurement
thermal neutron absorber,"An element, or mineral, that is particularly effective in absorbing thermal neutrons (neutrons with about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically less than 0.4 eV). The elements gadolinium, boron, chlorine, hydrogen and iron are thermal absorbers (in decreasing order of effectiveness). The effect of chlorine is used in a pulsed neutron capture log to distinguish salty water from hydrocarbons. In a thermal neutron porosity measurement, the effect of hydrogen is important, while boron and iron affect the response in shales.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thermal_neutron_absorber
thorium,"An element with an atomic number of 90. The 232Th isotope is radioactive and decays with a half-life of 1.4 * 1010 years through a series of intermediate isotopes to a stable isotope of lead. The intermediate isotopes emit a wide range of gamma rays, the most prominent being that of thallium, 208Tl. It is assumed that formations are in secular equilibrium; that is, the relative proportions of parent and daughter isotopes remain constant, and the measured spectrum is directly related to the amount of 232Th. The concentration in the Earth's crust is about 12 parts per million, ppm, by weight. Thorium-bearing minerals are rare. Thorium is a trace element associated with clays and heavy minerals. It is very immobile so that quantity measured today probably was present at the time of deposition. A log of thorium is presented in parts per million. It is often a good measure of clay content.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thorium
thermal capture,"A neutron interaction in which the neutron is absorbed by the target nucleus, producing an isotope in an excited state. The activated isotope de-excites instantly through the emission of characteristic gamma rays. Thermal capture, also called neutron capture, usually occurs at low thermal energies at which the neutrons have about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically below 0.4 eV (0.025 eV at room temperature). Some elements are better thermal absorbers than others. Neutron capture is an important principle behind the pulsed neutron capture log, the elemental capture spectroscopy log, the pulsed neutron spectroscopy log and the thermal neutron porosity measurement.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thermal_capture
thermal diffusion length,"A parameter used to characterize thermal neutron interactions in bulk material. Thermal diffusion length (Ld) is the characteristic distance between the point at which a neutron becomes thermal and the point of its final capture. It is related to the quantity of thermal absorbers in the formation, and therefore is an important factor in the thermal neutron porosity measurement. Thermal neutrons have about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically less than 0.4 eV (0.025 eV at room temperature).",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thermal_diffusion_length

In logging while drilling, this time is different for each log, since it depends on the drilling rate and the distance between the bit and the particular logging sensor.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/time_after_bit
time-lapse,"Pertaining to techniques in which the same quantity is measured at different times in the life of a reservoir. Normally the only change in a time-lapse measurement or survey will be due to changes in water or gas saturation. Thus, a comparison of two logs run at different times, such as a year apart, should simply reflect the change in fluid saturations in the pore space. The most common time-lapse logs are made with pulsed neutron capture, pulsed neutron spectroscopy and borehole gravity measurements.",Adjective,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/time-lapse
tick mark,"In logging while drilling, a mark associated with each measurement indicating when a sample was taken. It is usually presented as a short bar in the depth track. Widely spaced tick marks indicate a low sampling rate. In wireline logging, a tick mark indicates the cumulative volume of some quantity, such as hole volume or traveltime. The term is sometimes spelled tic mark.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tick_mark
tapered cutoff,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, the use of a gradual rather than a sharp cutoff to distinguish between bound water and free water. A sharp cutoff at, for example T2 = 33 ms in sandstones, is normally used to distinguish free water (all T2s above 33 ms) from bound water (all T2s below 33ms). In a water-filled rock, in the fast diffusion limit, T2 is directly related to pore size. The distinction between bound and free water is based on the assumption that all free water resides in large pores, and all bound water in small pores. However, in rocks with large pores, a significant volume of bound water exists on the surface of the grains around a large pore. Being part of a large pore, it gives a long T2 and will be incorrectly counted as free water. One solution is the tapered cutoff, in which the bound water is the sum of all the T2 below a minimum, for example 5 ms, and is then a progressively smaller fraction of the volume at T2s up to a maximum, for example 500 ms. All signal above 500 ms represents free water. The form of the taper is usually empirical, but is based on some model of pore shape, such as a bundle of tubes. See Kleinberg RL and Boyd A: 'Tapered Cutoffs for Magnetic Resonance Bound Water Volume' paper SPE 38737, presented at the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, San Antonio, Texas, USA, October 5-8, 1997.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tapered_cutoff
measurement range,"The range of values for a quantity for which the error of a measuring instrument is intended to lie within specified limits. Within this range, the measurement has a well-defined accuracy or applicability. Outside the range, it does not. It is distinct from the operating range, within which the instrument will provide a measurement but the error is not well-defined.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/measurement_range
Z/A effect,"The ratio of the electron density to the bulk density. The electron density is equal to the bulk density multiplied by 2Z/A where Z is the average atomic number and A is the average atomic weight of the formation. The density log actually responds to electron density, whereas the desired measurement is the bulk density. Although for most rocks 2Z/A is close to 1, it is not practical to adjust 2Z/A for each formation. Instead the electron density is scaled to give the correct bulk density in limestone filled with fresh water. Then it is found that in the majority of sedimentary rocks, the log reads the bulk density within 1%. The main exceptions are halite, sylvite and low-pressure gas, because the 2Z/A of chlorine and hydrogen are not close to 1.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/z/za_effect
mercury displacement method,"A technique for measuring the bulk volume of a core sample by observing the displacement of mercury in a chamber. The chamber is first filled to a reference level and the volume recorded. The sample is introduced and the new volume recorded. The difference is the bulk volume of the sample. If the sample is weighed, its bulk density can also be calculated. Mercury is used because it is strongly nonwetting and therefore does not enter the pore space.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mercury_displacement_method
microresistivity,"Related to a log of the resistivity of the flushed zone recorded by a wireline electrode device. The device is mounted on a pad and pressed against the borehole wall. Several designs exist, for example microlog, microlaterolog, proximity log, microspherical log, and microcylindrical log. The microlog, being unfocused, is a more qualitative measurement. The other measurements are focused. They try to minimize the effect of mudcake and rugose hole while reading as short a distance as possible into the formation to remain unaffected by the undisturbed zone. They are usually combined with a laterolog or induction log to correct the latter for the effects of invasion and for saturation determination in quick-look ratio methods. The logs are presented on a logarithmic scale from, for example 0.2 to 2000 ohm-m.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/microresistivity
membrane potential,"The electromagnetic force generated across an ion-selective membrane when solutions on either side of the membrane have different salinities. Shales and clays are cationic membranes, since they allow the passage of cations, such as Na+, but not anions, such as Cl-. When the drilling mud in the borehole and the formation water have different salinities, a membrane potential is generated at the boundary between a shale and a permeable formation. This potential is one component of the electrochemical potential, from which the spontaneous potential (SP) log is derived. The other, much smaller component is the liquid-junction potential. The membrane potential is reduced if the shale is not a good cationic membrane, or in other words has a low cation-exchange capacity. A membrane potential may also be generated across the mudcake if there is no flushed zone; for example if the mud filtrate has moved vertically since invasion took place, and by clay within a shaly sand, but with the opposite polarity to the normal SP potentials. The membrane potential is also used in core analysis to determine the cation-exchange capacity of a sample. In this case, the clay within the sample is the ion-selective membrane, and the potential generated across it is related to the cation-exchange capacity per unit pore volume, Qv. As a method of measuring Qv, the technique is faster than the multiple salinity method, and more representative of the in-situ value than destructive methods such as conductometric titration. However, care is needed in making the measurement and deriving the appropriate Qv.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/membrane_potential
microspherical log,"An electrode device with small spacings from which the current flow, and hence the measurement, is focused a short distance into the formation. The microspherical log measures the resistivity of the flushed zone with minimum influence from the mudcake or the undisturbed zone. The principle of spherical focusing is used. The electrodes are mounted on a pad that is pressed against the borehole wall. In a typical tool design, 90% of the signal comes from within 3 in [7.6 cm] of the pad, ensuring that the undisturbed zone rarely has an effect.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/microspherical_log
measure point,"The position on a logging tool that best represents the center of the vertical response of the measurement. For a simple single transmitter-single receiver measurement, the measure point is half-way between the transmitter and receiver.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/measure_point
microlog,"An unfocused electrode device with small spacings, mounted on a pad and pressed against the borehole wall. The typical microlog has one current-emitting electrode and two measure electrodes in line above it, one at 1 in [2.5 cm], the other at 2 in [5 cm]. The potential at the 2-in electrode gives a 2-in micronormal log. The difference in potential between the two measure electrodes gives a 1-in x 1-in microinverse log. The micronormal reads deeper than the microinverse. Introduced in 1948, the microlog is used to detect permeable zones across which a mudcake has formed. Since the mudcake is usually less resistive than the invaded zone, the microinverse will read less than the micronormal opposite permeable zones. If the resistivity and thickness of the mudcake are known, it is possible to estimate the resistivity of the flushed zone. The log is usually presented on a linear scale, chosen to emphasize the lower readings often seen opposite permeable zones with mudcake.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/microlog
microlaterolog,"An electrode device with small spacings from which the current flow, and hence the measurement, is focused a short distance into the formation. Introduced in 1953, the microlaterolog measures the resistivity of the flushed zone with minimum influence from the mudcake or the undisturbed zone. The central current emitting electrode (A0) is surrounded by a guard electrode that emits sufficient current to focus the current from A0 a certain distance into the formation. The electrodes are mounted on a pad that is pressed against the borehole wall. In a typical tool design, 90% of the signal comes from within 3 in. [7.6 cm] of the pad, ensuring that the undisturbed zone rarely has an effect.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/microlaterolog
microcylindrical log,"An electrode device with small spacings from which the current flow, and hence the measurement, is focused a short distance into the formation. The microcylindrical log measures the resistivity of the flushed zone with minimum influence from the mudcake or the undisturbed zone. The electrodes are mounted on a pad that is pressed against the borehole wall. The current is focused both parallel and perpendicular to the tool axis. Three measurements are made, each with a different depth of investigation. These measurements are combined to solve for the mudcake and flushed-zone resistivity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/microcylindrical_log
medium induction,A particular type of induction log designed to read an intermediate distance into the formation while maintaining good vertical resolution. The medium-induction array of eight coils (IM) is produced by three transmitters and five receivers running at 20 kHz. A small fourth transmitter coil was added in tools built since 1968. The midpoint of the integrated radial geometrical factor is 30 in [76 cm] in radius. The vertical resolution is about 4 ft [1.2 m] but varies with conditions. The IM is combined with a deep-induction log on the same sonde to produce a dual induction log.,Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/medium_induction
microporosity,"That part of the pore space that has a characteristic dimension less than 1 micron. In general, this includes not only very small pores but also the porosity associated with surface roughness.

magnetic mud,"A drilling mud with a significant magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic susceptibility may affect the response of some logging measurements, mainly the induction X-signal and nuclear magnetic resonance logs. The most common magnetic muds contain iron filings or magnetite. Other paramagnetic minerals such as hematite and ilmenite may contribute, although their magnetic susceptibility is considerably less.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/magnetic_mud
measurement after drilling,"Measurements made by measurements-while-drilling (MWD) tools subsequent to the initial bit run. MWD logs are recorded while drilling the well. However, these tools can also record logs at later times when the drillstring is in the hole. This may be while pulling out after drilling, or on a subsequent bit run or circulating trip. The latter is also known as logging while tripping.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/measurement_after_drilling
magnetic resonance,"A phenomenon by which a nucleus absorbs electromagnetic radiation of a specific frequency in the presence of a strong magnetic field. Isidor Isaac Rabi (1898 to 1988), an American physicist born in Austria, first detected magnetic resonance in 1938. Since then, magnetic resonance has been applied to the detection of light atoms (such as hydrogen in hydrocarbons) and as a nondestructive way to study the human body.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/magnetic_resonance
maximum recorded temperature,"The highest temperature recorded on a logging run. It is usually taken to be the bottomhole temperature for use in log interpretation. However, on the first logging run or runs after circulation, the mud may be hottest some distance above the bottom of the hole.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/maximum_recorded_temperature
mudcake,"The residue deposited on a permeable medium when a slurry, such as a drilling fluid, is forced against the medium under a pressure. Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filter-cake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filter cake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filter cake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mudcake
mud filtrate,"The liquid that passes through a filter cake from a slurry held against the filter medium, driven by differential pressure. Dynamic or static filtration can produce a filtrate.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mud_filtrate
minute mark,"An annotation made on a log print once every minute. By reading the depth interval between each minute mark, it is possible to check the logging speed.

multiple salinity,"A technique used for the determination of the electrical properties of a shaly core sample. The sample is flushed with brines of different salinities, and the conductivity determined after each flush. A plot of the conductivity of the sample (C0) versus the conductivity of the brine (Cw) gives the excess conductivity caused by clays and other surface conductors. Then, using a suitable model (Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS) it is possible to determine the intrinsic formation factor and porosity exponent, and the cation-exchange capacity.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiple_salinity
m,"The exponent of porosity, m, in the relation of formation factor, F, to porosity, phi. In the Archie equation, F = 1/phim, H.

The more general term is porosity exponent.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/m
effective porosity,The interconnected pore volume or void space in a rock that contributes to fluid flow or permeability in a reservoir. Effective porosity excludes isolated pores and pore volume occupied by water adsorbed on clay minerals or other grains. Total porosity is the total void space in the rock whether or not it contributes to fluid flow. Effective porosity is typically less than total porosity.,Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/effective_porosity
effective water saturation,"The fraction of water in the pore space corresponding to the effective porosity. It is expressed in volume/volume, percent, or saturation units. Unless otherwise stated, water saturation is the fraction of formation water in the undisturbed zone. The saturation is known as the total water saturation if the pore space is the total porosity, but is called effective water saturation if the pore space is the effective porosity. If used without qualification, the term water saturation usually refers to the effective water saturation.",Noun,Formation Evaluation,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/effective_water_saturation
