flow assurance,"The design, strategies and principles for ensuring that there is uninterrupted hydrocarbon production flowing from the reservoir to the point of sale. Impediments to hydrocarbon flow in wellbores and flowlines may arise from an interrelated combination of effects involving flow dynamics—single and multiphase fluid flow—and production chemistry. At reservoir pressure and temperature conditions, fluids are single phase. As they travel toward the production facility, the fluids experience changes in pressure and temperature that result in multiple fluid phases and the formation, accumulation and dispersal of inorganic and organic solids that may become impediments to production. Multiphase flow may cause phenomena such as slugging in subsea flowlines and risers. Solids deposition may cause flowline plugging anywhere in the system.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/f/flow_assurance

hydrogen sulfide,"[H2S] An extraordinarily poisonous gas with a molecular formula of H2S. At low concentrations, H2S has the odor of rotten eggs, but at higher, lethal concentrations, it is odorless. H2S is hazardous to workers and a few seconds of exposure at relatively low concentrations can be lethal, but exposure to lower concentrations can also be harmful. The effect of H2S depends on duration, frequency and intensity of exposure as well as the susceptibility of the individual. Hydrogen sulfide is a serious and potentially lethal hazard, so awareness, detection and monitoring of H2S is essential. Since hydrogen sulfide gas is present in some subsurface formations, drilling and other operational crews must be prepared to use detection equipment, personal protective equipment, proper training and contingency procedures in H2S-prone areas. Hydrogen sulfide is produced during the decomposition of organic matter and occurs with hydrocarbons in some areas. It enters drilling mud from subsurface formations and can also be generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria in stored muds. H2S can cause sulfide-stress-corrosion cracking of metals. Because it is corrosive, H2S production may require costly special production equipment such as stainless steel tubing. Sulfides can be precipitated harmlessly from water muds or oil muds by treatments with the proper sulfide scavenger. H2S is a weak acid, donating two hydrogen ions in neutralization reactions, forming HS- and S-2 ions. In water or water-base muds, the three sulfide species, H2S and HS- and S-2 ions, are in dynamic equilibrium with water and H+ and OH- ions. The percent distribution among the three sulfide species depends on pH. H2S is dominant at low pH, the HS- ion is dominant at mid-range pH and S2 ions dominate at high pH. In this equilibrium situation, sulfide ions revert to H2S if pH falls. Sulfides in water mud and oil mud can be quantitatively measured with the Garrett Gas Train according to procedures set by API.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrogen_sulfide

jar,"A mechanical device used downhole to deliver an impact load to another downhole component, especially when that component is stuck. There are two primary types, hydraulic and mechanical jars. While their respective designs are quite different, their operation is similar. Energy is stored in the drillstring and suddenly released by the jar when it fires. The principle is similar to that of a carpenter using a hammer. Kinetic energy is stored in the hammer as it is swung, and suddenly released to the nail and board when the hammer strikes the nail. Jars can be designed to strike up, down, or both. In the case of jarring up above a stuck bottomhole assembly, the driller slowly pulls up on the drillstring but the BHA does not move. Since the top of the drillstring is moving up, this means that the drillstring itself is stretching and storing energy. When the jars reach their firing point, they suddenly allow one section of the jar to move axially relative to a second, being pulled up rapidly in much the same way that one end of a stretched spring moves when released. After a few inches of movement, this moving section slams into a steel shoulder, imparting an impact load. In addition to the mechanical and hydraulic versions, jars are classified as drilling jars or fishing jars. The operation of the two types is similar, and both deliver approximately the same impact blow, but the drilling jar is built such that it can better withstand the rotary and vibrational loading associated with drilling.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/j/jar

jet cutter,"A downhole tool, generally run on wireline or coiled tubing, that uses the detonation of a shaped explosive charge to cut the surrounding tubing or casing wall. The cutting action leaves a relatively clean cut surface, although the explosive action tends to flare the cut ends, making retrieval of cut tubular difficult if the fishing tool engages on the external surfaces.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/j/jet_cutter
junk pusher,A downhole tool similar in function to a casing scraper. A junk pusher is run to ensure an unobstructed wellbore before setting a packer or similar fullbore device.,Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/j/junk_pusher
junk sub,A downhole tool with a profiled external surface designed to catch and retrieve junk or debris from the wellbore. The debris is carried up the tool-string annulus in the circulation fluid. An indented profile creating a larger annular area causes the fluid flow rate to drop and allows debris to drop into a basket or receptacle located at the base of the tool.,Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/j/junk_sub
neutralizing solution,"A fluid prepared to counteract the corrosive effect of acids or acidic treatment fluids.

ovality limit,"The maximum distortion permitted on the cross-sectional profile of a coiled tubing string. The mechanical performance of oval tubing deteriorates as the degree of ovality increases. The most critical effect is the ability of the tube to resist collapse under differential pressure. String ovality limits are generally determined by the maximum diameter that can pass through the primary pressure-control equipment. In high-pressure operations, the ovality limits will generally be reduced to maintain an adequate safety margin against string collapse.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/ovality_limit
overflush,A specially prepared fluid used to displace matrix acid treatments away from the wellbore at the conclusion of a stimulation treatment. The overflush is typically formulated from a weak acid solution or brine to maintain a low pH environment in the near-wellbore formation that prevents the precipitation of reaction products as the treatment fluids are flowed back. The overflush is normally a weak acid or brine pumped behind the main treating fluid (mixture of hydrofluoric [HF] and hydrochloric [HCl] or organic acids). The overflush has several purposes: · displacement of the nonreacted mud acid into the formation. · displacement of mud-acid reaction by-products such as amorphous silica. The minimum overflush volume should have at least 3 ft [1 m] of radial penetration inside the formation to displace potential problems away from the critical matrix. · removal of potential oil-wet relative-permeability problems caused by some corrosion inhibitors.,Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/o/overflush
pickling fluid,"A relatively weak, inhibited acid used to remove scale, rust and similar deposits from the internal surfaces of equipment such as treating lines, pumping equipment or the tubing string through which an acid or chemical treatment is to be pumped.

weight indicator,"One of the instruments that the driller uses to monitor and improve the operating efficiencies of the drilling operation. The actual measurement of weight is made with a hydraulic gauge attached to the dead line of the drilling line. As tension increases in the drilling line, more hydraulic fluid is forced through the instrument, turning the hands of the indicator. The weight that is measured includes everything exerting tension on the wire rope, including the traveling blocks and cable itself. Hence, to have an accurate weight measurement of the drillstring, the driller must first make a zero offset adjustment to account for the traveling blocks and items other than the drillstring. Then the indicated weight will represent the drillstring (drillpipe and bottomhole assembly). However, the driller is only nominally interested in this weight for most operations. The weight of interest is the weight applied to the bit on the bottom of the hole. The driller could simply take the rotating and hanging off bottom weight, say 300,000 pounds [136,200 kg], and subtract from that the amount of rotating on bottom weight, say 250,000 pounds [113,500 kg], to get a bit weight of 50,000 pounds [22,700 kg]. However, most rigs are equipped with a weight indicator that has a second indicator dial that can be set to read zero (""zeroed"") with the drillstring hanging free, and works backwards from the main indicator dial. After proper zeroing, any weight set on bottom (that takes weight away from the main dial), has the effect of adding weight to this secondary dial, so that the driller can read weight on bit directly from the dial.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/weight_indicator
well stimulation,"A treatment performed to restore or enhance the productivity of a well. Stimulation treatments fall into two main groups, hydraulic fracturing treatments and matrix treatments. Fracturing treatments are performed above the fracture pressure of the reservoir formation and create a highly conductive flow path between the reservoir and the wellbore. Matrix treatments are performed below the reservoir fracture pressure and generally are designed to restore the natural permeability of the reservoir following damage to the near-wellbore area.

acetic acid,"An organic acid used in oil- and gas-well stimulation treatments. Less corrosive than the commonly used hydrochloric acid, acetic acid treatments can be more easily inhibited or retarded for treatments of long duration. This is necessary particularly in applications requiring the protection of exotic alloys or in high-temperature wells. In most cases, acetic acid is used in conjunction with hydrochloric acid and other acid additives. It can also be used as a chelating agent.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/acetic_acid
accumulator,"A device used in a hydraulic system to store energy or, in some applications, dampen pressure fluctuations. Energy is stored by compressing a precharged gas bladder with hydraulic fluid from the operating or charging system. Depending on the fluid volume and precharge pressure of the accumulator, a limited amount of hydraulic energy is then available independent of any other power source. Well pressure-control systems typically incorporate sufficient accumulator capacity to enable the blowout preventer to be operated with all other power shut down.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/accumulator
accelerator,"A downhole tool used in conjunction with a jar to store energy that is suddenly released when the jar is activated. The energy provides an impact force that operates associated downhole tools or, in a contingency role, helps release a tool string that has become stuck. Depending on the operating mode, the energy in tension or compression can be stored by means of a mechanical spring or a compressible fluid such as nitrogen gas. Accelerators should be selected on the basis of their compatibility with the jar to be used.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/accelerator

acid stimulation,"The treatment of a reservoir formation with a stimulation fluid containing a reactive acid. In sandstone formations, the acid reacts with the soluble substances in the formation matrix to enlarge the pore spaces. In carbonate formations, the acid dissolves the entire formation matrix. In each case, the matrix acidizing treatment improves the formation permeability to enable enhanced production of reservoir fluids. Matrix acidizing operations are ideally performed at high rate, but at treatment pressures below the fracture pressure of the formation. This enables the acid to penetrate the formation and extend the depth of treatment while avoiding damage to the reservoir formation.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/a/acid_stimulation

shear ram,"A blowout preventer (BOP) closing element fitted with hardened tool steel blades designed to cut the drillpipe or tubing when the BOP is closed, and then fully close to provide isolation or sealing of the wellbore. A shear ram is normally used as a last resort to regain pressure control of a well that is flowing. Once the pipe is cut (or sheared) by the shear rams, it is usually left hanging in the BOP stack, and kill operations become more difficult. The joint of drillpipe or tubing is destroyed in the process, but the rest of the string is unharmed by the operation of shear rams.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shear_ram
shear stock,The material from which shear pins are typically cut.

stripper rubber,"The sealing element used in coiled tubing or snubbing stripper systems. The stripper element is a consumable product and generally should be replaced for each operation. Coiled tubing elements can be replaced with the tubing in place, enabling a worn or leaking element to be replaced during an operation. Snubbing stripper rubbers are of single-piece construction and cannot be changed with the work string in place.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stripper_rubber
stripping,"The act of putting drillpipe into the wellbore when the blowout preventers (BOPs) are closed and pressure is contained in the well. This is necessary when a kick is taken, since well kill operations should always be conducted with the drillstring on bottom, and not somewhere up the wellbore. If only the annular BOP has been closed, the drillpipe may be slowly and carefully lowered into the wellbore, and the BOP itself will open slightly to permit the larger diameter tool joints to pass through. If the well has been closed with the use of ram BOPs, the tool joints will not pass by the closed ram element. Hence, while keeping the well closed with either another ram or the annular BOP, the ram must be opened manually, then the pipe lowered until the tool joint is just below the ram, and then the ram closed again. This procedure is repeated whenever a tool joint must pass by a ram BOP. Rig crews are usually required to practice ram-to-ram and ram-to-annular stripping operations as part of their well control certifications. In stripping operations, the combination of the pressure in the well and the weight of the drillstring is such that the pipe falls in the hole under its own weight, whereas in snubbing operations the pipe must be pushed into the hole.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stripping
secondary cementing,"Another term for remedial cementing, cementing operations performed to repair primary-cementing problems or to treat conditions arising after the wellbore has been constructed.

stimulation fluid,"A treatment fluid prepared for stimulation purposes, although the term most commonly is applied to matrix stimulation fluids. Most matrix stimulation fluids are acid or solvent-based, with hydrochloric acid being the most common base due to its reaction characteristics and its relative ease of control.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stimulation_fluid
stimulation by-product,"A compound formed by a secondary reaction of stimulation fluids with fluids or solids present in the reservoir matrix. The most damaging stimulation by-products are the insoluble precipitates that can form when the pH of the treatment fluid increases during the reaction process. Precipitates of iron compounds can be particularly problematic if conditions allow the formation of gelatinous, insoluble ferric compounds in the near-wellbore area.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stimulation_byproduct
sulfide stress cracking,"A type of spontaneous brittle failure in steels and other high-strength alloys when they are in contact with moist hydrogen sulfide and other sulfidic environments. Tool joints, hardened parts of blowout preventers and valve trim are particularly susceptible. For this reason, along with toxicity risks of hydrogen sulfide gas, it is essential that water muds be kept entirely free of soluble sulfides and especially hydrogen sulfide at low pH. Sulfide stress cracking is also called hydrogen sulfide cracking, sulfide cracking, sulfide corrosion cracking and sulfide stress-corrosion cracking. The variation of the name is due to the lack of agreement in the mechanism of failure. Some researchers consider sulfide-stress cracking a type of stress-corrosion cracking, while others consider it a type of hydrogen embrittlement.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sulfide_stress_cracking
shear-seal BOP,"An item of pressure-control equipment often fitted to the wellhead during well-intervention operations on live wells. Most commonly associated with coiled tubing operations, the shear-seal BOP is a ram-type preventer that performs the dual functions of shearing or cutting the tubing string and then fully closing to provide isolation or sealing of the wellbore. Shear-seal BOPs are most commonly used in offshore or high-pressure applications where an additional contingency pressure barrier is required.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shear-seal_bop
slugging pill,"Also called a slug, a volume of mud that is more dense than the mud in the drillpipe and wellbore annulus. A slug is used to displace mud out of the upper part of the drillpipe before pulling pipe out of the hole and is mixed in the pill pit by adding additional weighting material (barite) to a few barrels of mud from the surface pits. The pill is pumped into the top of the drillstring to push mud downward, out of the pipe, thus keeping the upper stands of pipe empty.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/slugging_pill

scraper,"Also called a pig, a device with blades or brushes inserted in a pipeline for cleaning purposes. The pressure of the oil stream behind pushes the pig along the pipeline to clean out rust, wax, scale and debris. To clean downhole tubulars a similar device, called a casing scraper or paraffin scraper, may be used.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/scraper
sandout,"A condition encountered during some hydraulic fracturing operations whereby the fracture cannot accept further sand or proppant and only the carrier fluid is injected into the formation. A sandout occurs when the concentration of proppant within the tubing string rapidly increases, creating a corresponding sudden increase in pump pressure.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sandout
sand lifting,"Another term for sand cleanout, the process of removing sand or similar fill from a wellbore. Many wells produce sand that may accumulate and restrict production if not removed from the wellbore by the production fluid. Coiled tubing and snubbing units are routinely used for sand-cleanout operations, enabling the well condition to be treated without removing the completion equipment or even killing the well.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sand_lifting

sequestering agent,"A chemical whose molecular structure can envelop and hold a certain type of ion in a stable and soluble complex. Divalent cations, such as hardness ions, form stable and soluble complex structures with several types of sequestering chemicals. When held inside the complex, the ions have a limited ability to react with other ions, clays or polymers. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a well-known sequestering agent for the hardness ions, such as Ca+2, and is the reagent solution used in the hardness test protocol published by API. Polyphosphates can also sequester hardness ions. The addition of sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) to a cement-contaminated mud renders the calcium ions essentially nonreactive with clays in the mud. As a side benefit, SAPP also lowers mud pH. Sequestering is not the same as precipitation because sequestering does not form a solid.",Noun,Drilling Fluids,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/sequestering_agent
safety clamp,A mechanical device attached to tool strings or flush surface tubulars as they are assembled or disassembled. The safety clamp prevents the tool string from being dropped downhole accidentally if the slips or elevators securing the string lose their grip.,Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/safety_clamp
safety joint,"A weak spot in the drillstring. Such a weak spot sometimes is intentionally put into the drillstring so that if tension in the drillstring exceeds a predetermined amount, the safety joint will part and the rest of the drillstring will be salvageable. A safety joint is commonly included in fishing strings and drillstem testing equipment, where the fish may be successfully caught by the fishing assembly, but tension to free the fish may prove insurmountable. By having the safety joint in the hole, the fishing company representative knows where the fishing string will part and what will be needed to latch onto the top of this additional fish.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/safety_joint
safety head,"Another term for shear-seal BOP, an item of pressure-control equipment often fitted to the wellhead during well-intervention operations on live wells.

Hence, while keeping the well closed with either another ram BOP or the annular BOP, the ram must be opened manually, then the pipe lowered until the tool joint is just below the ram, and then closing the ram again. This procedure is repeated whenever a tool joint must pass by a ram BOP. In snubbing operations, the pressure in the wellbore acting on the cross-sectional area of the tubular can exert sufficient force to overcome the weight of the drillstring, so the string must be pushed (or ""snubbed"") back into the wellbore.

spotting,"Placing a small volume or pill of fluid in a wellbore annulus to free differentially stuck pipe. Oil-base mud is the traditional stuck-pipe spotting fluid. Speed in mixing and placing the spot is of primary importance to successfully freeing pipe. Because of concern about mud disposal, spots used offshore are either synthetic-based emulsions or benign water-base formulations. Each type is supplied as prepackaged concentrate designed for rapid access and mixing at the rig. A spot frees pipe by covering the stuck region.

tapered string,"A string of drillpipe or casing that consists of two or more sizes or weights. In most tapered strings, a larger diameter pipe or casing is placed at the top of the wellbore and the smaller size at the bottom. Note that since the pipe is put into the well bottom first, the smaller pipe is run into the hole first, followed by the larger diameter. Other than the different sizes, which are usually chosen to optimize well economics, there is nothing distinctive about the pipe sections. However, pipe-handling tools must be available for each pipe size, not just one size, as is the typical case.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tapered_string

mill out,"To use a mill or similar downhole tool to cut and remove metal downhole. A mill is usually used to remove junk in the hole or to grind away all or part of a casing string. When milling out casing, the intent is to cut a window through the side of the casing or to remove a continuous section of the casing so that the wellbore may be deviated from the original well through the window or section removed. Successful milling operations require appropriate selection of milling tools, fluids and techniques. The mills, or similar cutting tools, must be compatible with the fish or casing materials and wellbore conditions. The circulated fluids should be capable of removing the milled material from the wellbore. Finally, the techniques employed should be appropriate to the anticipated conditions and the likely time required to reach the operation objectives.",Verb,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mill_out
mill,"A tool that grinds metal downhole. A mill is usually used to remove junk in the hole or to grind away all or part of a casing string. In the case of junk, the metal must be broken into smaller pieces to facilitate removal from the wellbore so that drilling can continue. When milling casing, the intent is to cut a window through the side of the casing or to remove a continuous section of the casing so that the wellbore may be deviated from the original well through the window or section removed. Depending on the type of grinding or metal removal required, the shape of the cutting structures of mills varies. Virtually all mills, however, utilize tungsten carbine cutting surfaces.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mill
mill shoe,"A downhole tool routinely used in fishing operations to prepare the top and outside surface of a fish, generally to allow an overshot or similar fishing tool to engage cleanly on the fish.

Finally, the techniques employed should be appropriate to the anticipated conditions and the likely time required to reach the operation objectives.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/milling
matrix acidizing,"The treatment of a reservoir formation with a stimulation fluid containing a reactive acid. In sandstone formations, the acid reacts with the soluble substances in the formation matrix to enlarge the pore spaces. In carbonate formations, the acid dissolves the entire formation matrix. In each case, the matrix acidizing treatment improves the formation permeability to enable enhanced production of reservoir fluids. Matrix acidizing operations are ideally performed at high rate, but at treatment pressures below the fracture pressure of the formation. This enables the acid to penetrate the formation and extend the depth of treatment while avoiding damage to the reservoir formation.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/matrix_acidizing

marker joint,"A joint of tubing used in a workover or completion tubing string that serves as a position or depth indicator. In most cases, a marker joint is significantly shorter than other joints in the string so that it is easily noticeable on correlation logs or when retrieving a work string, such as on a snubbing or hydraulic workover unit.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/marker_joint
maximum treating pressure,The surface-pump pressure limit below which a treatment should be performed. The maximum treating pressure is determined to avoid fracturing the formation or damaging completion components. The maximum treating pressure is generally calculated to ensure that the pump-pressure limit equates to downhole and reservoir conditions that are within the design limits of the treatment.,Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/maximum_treating_pressure
matrix stimulation,"A treatment designed to treat the near-wellbore reservoir formation rather than other areas of the production conduit, such as the casing across the production interval, production tubulars or the perforations. Matrix stimulation treatments include acid, solvent and chemical treatments to improve the permeability of the near-wellbore formation, enhancing the productivity of a well. Matrix stimulation is a process of injecting a fluid into the formation, either an acid or solvent at pressures below the fracturing pressure, to improve the production or injection flow capacity of a well. The goal of a matrix treatment is different in sandstones than in carbonates. In sandstones, matrix treatments restore or improve the natural formation permeability around the wellbore by removing formation damage, by dissolving material plugging the pores or by enlarging the pore spaces. In carbonates, matrix stimulation creates new, highly conductive channels (wormholes) that bypass damage. Because of these differences, the selection criteria for the treating fluid are also distinct. For sandstone treatments, knowledge of the extent, type of damage, location, origin, reservoir mineralogy (petrographic study) and compatibility of the treating fluid with the formation are especially important. In carbonate treatments, reservoir temperature, pumping rate and fluid type become more significant because these parameters directly affect the reactivity of the treating fluid with the reservoir rock. A sandstone matrix stimulation treatment is generally composed of a hydrochloric acid [HCl] preflush, a main treating fluid (HCl-HF mixtures) and an overflush (weak acid solution or brine). The treating fluid is maintained under pressure inside the reservoir for a period of time, after which the well is swabbed and returned to production. In carbonate reservoirs, HCl is the most common fluid used. Organic acids such as formic and acetic acid are used in either sandstone or carbonate acidizing, mainly in retarded-acid systems or in high-temperature applications. Matrix stimulation is also called matrix treatment or matrix acidizing.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/matrix_stimulation
mud acid,"A mixture of hydrofluoric acid [HF] and hydrochloric acid [HCl] or organic acid used as the main fluid in a sandstone matrix treatment. Hydrochloric acid or organic acid is mixed with HF to keep the pH low when it spends, thereby preventing detrimental precipitates. The name mud acid was given to these mixtures because they were originally developed to treat damage from siliceous drilling muds. Mud acid is also called hydrofluoric-hydrochloric acid.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mud_acid
mutual solvent,"A chemical additive for stimulation treatments that is soluble in oil, water and acid-based treatment fluids.

The final job procedures and treatment parameters are refined according to the results of the minifrac treatment.,Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/minifrac
external cutter,"A downhole tool used to cut tubing or similar tubulars that have become stuck in the wellbore. The external cutter slips over the fish or tubing to be cut. Special hardened metal-cutters on the inside of the tool engage on the external surfaces of the fish. External cutters are generally used to remove the topmost, possibly damaged, portion of a fish to enable an overshot, or similar fishing tools, to engage on an undamaged surface.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/external_cutter
endless tubing,"Another term for coiled tubing, a long, continuous length of pipe wound on a spool. The pipe is straightened prior to pushing into a wellbore and rewound to coil the pipe back onto the transport and storage spool. Depending on the pipe diameter (1 in. to 4 1/2 in.) and the spool size, coiled tubing can range from 2,000 ft to 15,000 ft [610 to 4,570 m] or greater length.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/endless_tubing
excess cement,"The cement slurry remaining in the wellbore following a cement squeeze in which the objective is to squeeze slurry into the perforations and behind the casing or liner. The volume of slurry required to effect a successful squeeze is often difficult to estimate. In most cases, an excess allowance is made since a shortage of slurry would result in failure of the operation. Removal of the excess cement slurry before it sets has been a key objective in the development of modern cement-squeeze techniques.",Noun,Well Workover And Intervention,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/excess_cement
entrained gas,The gas present in the fluids of a wellbore circulatory system. Many well-intervention operations are conducted with the well live or held on balance.
