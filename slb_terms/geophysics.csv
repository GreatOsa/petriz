electromagnetic method,"A group of techniques in which natural or artificially generated electric or magnetic fields are measured at the Earth's surface or in boreholes in order to map variations in the Earth's electrical properties (resistivity, permeability or permittivity). Most applications of surface electromagnetic methods today are for mineral and groundwater exploration or for shallow environmental mapping. Electromagnetic or electrical logging is, however, the main technique used in oil exploration to measure the amount of hydrocarbons in the pores of underground reservoirs. Inductive electromagnetic (EM) methods include a variety of low frequency (a few Hz to several kHz) techniques deploying large or small wire coils at or near the surface.

crosswell seismic tomography,"A survey technique that measures the seismic signal transmitted from a source, located in one well, to a receiver array in a neighboring well. The resulting data are processed to create a reflection image or to map the acoustic velocity or other properties (velocities of P- and S-waves, for example) of the area between wells. Placement of the source and receiver array in adjacent wells not only enables the formation between wells to be surveyed, it also avoids seismic signal propagation through attenuative near-surface formations. Another advantage is that it places the source and receiver near the reservoir zone of interest, thereby obtaining better resolution than is possible with conventional surface seismic surveys. This technique is often used for high-resolution reservoir characterization when surface seismic or vertical seismic profile (VSP) data lack resolution, or for time-lapse monitoring of fluid movements in the reservoir.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/c/crosswell_seismic_tomography

Double refraction, or birefringence, occurs in optical mineralogy (see petrography) when plane-polarized light passes through an anisotropic mineral and emerges as two rays traveling at different speeds, the difference between which is characteristic of a mineral. In seismology, incident S-waves can exhibit birefringence as they split into a quasi-shear and a pure-shear wave. Although birefringence was first described by Danish physician Erasmus Bartholin (1625 to 1698) in crystals in 1669, the phenomenon was not fully understood until French physicist Etienne-Louis Malus (1775 to 1812) described polarized light in 1808.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/double_refraction
dogleg,"A particularly crooked place in a wellbore where the trajectory of the wellbore in three-dimensional space changes rapidly. While a dogleg is sometimes created intentionally by directional drillers, the term more commonly refers to a section of the hole that changes direction faster than anticipated or desired, usually with harmful side effects. In surveying wellbore trajectories, a standard calculation of dogleg severity is made, usually expressed in two-dimensional degrees per 100 feet [degrees per 30 m] of wellbore length. There are several difficulties associated with doglegs. First, the wellbore is not located in the planned path. Second is the possibility that a planned casing string may no longer easily fit through the curved section. Third, repeated abrasion by the drillstring in a particular location of the dogleg results in a worn spot called a keyseat, in which the bottomhole assembly components may become stuck as they are pulled through the section. Fourth, casing successfully cemented through the dogleg may wear unusually quickly due to higher contact forces between the drillstring and the inner diameter (ID) of the casing through the dogleg. Fifth, a relatively stiff bottomhole assembly may not easily fit through the dogleg section drilled with a relatively limber BHA. Sixth, excessive doglegs increase the overall friction to the drillstring, increasing the likelihood of getting stuck or not reaching the planned total depth. Usually these problems are manageable. If the dogleg impairs the well, remedial action can be taken, such as reaming or underreaming through the dogleg, or even sidetracking in extreme situations.",Noun,Drilling,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dogleg

directivity,"The property of some seismic sources whereby the amplitude, frequency, velocity or other property of the resulting seismic waves varies with direction. A directional charge, such as a length of primer cord or a linear array of charges, can be used when directivity is desirable. Directivity is also a property of geophone arrays, air guns, explosives or vibrators, which can be positioned to reduce horizontal traveling noise such as ground roll. Receivers in the form of groups in which the individual geophones or hydrophones are separated from each other in linear (1D) or areal (2D) arrays are directional, and are designed to suppress signal arriving nearly horizontally and to pass nearly vertical arrivals with minimum attenuation or distortion. Directivity is often present, but the difficulty in accounting for it during seismic processing makes it undesirable in most cases.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/directivity

In geophysics, reflection refers to the seismic energy or signal that returns from an interface of contrasting acoustic impedance, known as a reflector, according to Snell's law. Reflection seismic surveys are useful for mapping geologic structures in the subsurface, interpreting sedimentary environments and evaluating hydrocarbon accumulations that might occur as amplitude anomalies.

Kirchhoff migration,"A method of seismic migration that uses the integral form (Kirchhoff equation) of the wave equation. All methods of seismic migration involve the backpropagation (or continuation) of the seismic wavefield from the region where it was measured (Earth's surface or along a borehole) into the region to be imaged. In Kirchhoff migration, this is done by using the Kirchhoff integral representation of a field at a given point as a (weighted) superposition of waves propagating from adjacent points and times. Continuation of the wavefield requires a background model of seismic velocity, which is usually a model of constant or smoothly varying velocity. Because of the integral form of Kirchhoff migration, its implementation reduces to stacking the data along curves that trace the arrival time of energy scattered by image points in the earth.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/k/kirchhoff_migration

Induced polarization is observed when a steady current through two electrodes in the Earth is shut off: the voltage does not return to zero instantaneously, but rather decays slowly, indicating that charge has been stored in the rocks. This charge, which accumulates mainly at interfaces between clay minerals, is responsible for the IP effect. This effect can be measured in either the time domain by observing the rate of decay of voltage or in the frequency domain by measuring phase shifts between sinusoidal currents and voltages.

permeability,"The ability, or measurement of a rock's ability, to transmit fluids, typically measured in darcies or millidarcies. The term was basically defined by Henry Darcy, who showed that the common mathematics of heat transfer could be modified to adequately describe fluid flow in porous media. Formations that transmit fluids readily, such as sandstones, are described as permeable and tend to have many large, well-connected pores. Impermeable formations, such as shales and siltstones, tend to be finer grained or of a mixed grain size, with smaller, fewer, or less interconnected pores. Absolute permeability is the measurement of the permeability conducted when a single fluid, or phase, is present in the rock. Effective permeability is the ability to preferentially flow or transmit a particular fluid through a rock when other immiscible fluids are present in the reservoir (for example, effective permeability of gas in a gas-water reservoir). The relative saturations of the fluids as well as the nature of the reservoir affect the effective permeability. Relative permeability is the ratio of effective permeability of a particular fluid at a particular saturation to absolute permeability of that fluid at total saturation. If a single fluid is present in a rock, its relative permeability is 1.0. Calculation of relative permeability allows for comparison of the different abilities of fluids to flow in the presence of each other, since the presence of more than one fluid generally inhibits flow.",Noun,Geology,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/permeability

vertical seismic profile (VSP),"A class of borehole seismic measurements used for correlation with surface seismic data, for obtaining images of higher resolution than surface seismic images and for looking ahead of the drill bit; also called a VSP. Purely defined, VSP refers to measurements made in a vertical wellbore using geophones inside the wellbore and a source at the surface near the well. In the more general context, VSPs vary in the well configuration, the number and location of sources and geophones, and how they are deployed. Most VSPs use a surface seismic source, which is commonly a vibrator on land and an air gun in offshore or marine environments. VSPs include the zero-offset VSP, offset VSP, walkaway VSP, walk-above VSP, salt-proximity VSP, shear-wave VSP, and drill-noise or seismic-while-drilling VSP. A VSP is a much more detailed survey than a check-shot survey because the geophones are more closely spaced, typically on the order of 25 m [82 ft], whereas a check-shot survey might include measurements of intervals hundreds of meters apart. Also, a VSP uses the reflected energy contained in the recorded trace at each receiver position as well as the first direct path from source to receiver. The check-shot survey uses only the direct path traveltime. In addition to tying well data to seismic data, the vertical seismic profile also enables converting seismic data to zero-phase data and distinguishing primary reflections from multiples.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/vertical_seismic_profile
velocity,"The rate at which a wave travels through a medium (a scalar) or the rate at which a body is displaced in a given direction (a vector), commonly symbolized by v. Unlike the physicist's definition of velocity as a vector, its usage in geophysics is as a property of a medium-distance divided by traveltime. Velocity can be determined from laboratory measurements, acoustic logs, vertical seismic profiles or from velocity analysis of seismic data. Velocity can vary vertically, laterally and azimuthally in anisotropic media such as rocks, and tends to increase with depth in the Earth because compaction reduces porosity. Velocity also varies as a function of how it is derived from the data. For example, the stacking velocity derived from normal moveout measurements of common depth point gathers differs from the average velocity measured vertically from a check-shot or vertical seismic profile (VSP). Velocity would be the same only in a constant velocity (homogeneous) medium.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/velocity

vibratory seismic data,"Seismic data whose energy source is a truck-mounted device called a vibrator that uses a vibrating plate to generate waves of seismic energy; also known as Vibroseis data (Vibroseis is a mark of Conoco). The frequency and duration of the energy can be controlled and varied according to the terrain and type of seismic data desired. The vibrator typically emits a linear ""sweep"" of at least seven seconds, beginning with high frequencies and decreasing with time (""downsweeping"") or going from low to high frequency (""upsweeping""). The frequency can also be changed in a nonlinear manner, such that certain frequencies are emitted longer than others. The resulting source wavelet is not impulsive.

wavelet extraction,"A step in seismic processing to determine the shape of the wavelet, also known as the embedded wavelet, that would be produced by a wave train impinging upon an interface with a positive reflection coefficient. Wavelets may also be extracted by using a model for the reflections in a seismic trace, such as a synthetic seismogram. A wavelet is generated by deconvolving the trace with the set of reflection coefficients of the synthetic seismogram, a process also known as deterministic wavelet extraction. Wavelets may be extracted without a model for the reflections by generating a power spectrum of the data. By making certain assumptions, such as that the power spectrum contains information about the wavelet (and not the geology) and that the wavelet is of a certain phase (minimum, zero), a wavelet may be generated. This is also called statistical wavelet extraction. A particular processing approach to establishing the embedded wavelet is to compare the processed seismic response with the response measured by a vertical seismic profile (VSP) or generated synthetically through a synthetic seismogram in which the embedded wavelet is known. The wavelet can also be extracted through the autocorrelation of the seismic trace, in which case the phase of the wavelet has to be assumed.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wavelet_extraction
wavelet,"A one-dimensional pulse, usually the basic response from a single reflector. Its key attributes are its amplitude, frequency and phase. The wavelet originates as a packet of energy from the source point, having a specific origin in time, and is returned to the receivers as a series of events distributed in time and energy. The distribution is a function of velocity and density changes in the subsurface and the relative position of the source and receiver. The energy that returns cannot exceed what was input, so the energy in any received wavelet decays with time as more partitioning takes place at interfaces. Wavelets also decay due to the loss of energy as heat during propagation. This is more extensive at high frequency, so wavelets tend to contain less high-frequency energy relative to low frequencies at longer traveltimes. Some wavelets are known by their shape and spectral content, such as the Ricker wavelet.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/wavelet

Walkaway VSPs in which the receivers are placed just above the reservoir are gaining acceptance as a tool to quantify seismic attributes and calibrate surface seismic data.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/walkaway_vertical_seismic_profile

The data can then be correlated to surface seismic data by correcting the sonic log and generating a synthetic seismogram to confirm or modify seismic interpretations. It differs from a vertical seismic profile in the number and density of receiver depths recorded; geophone positions may be widely and irregularly located in the wellbore, whereas a vertical seismic profile usually has numerous geophones positioned at closely and regularly spaced intervals in the wellbore.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/w/well_shoot

Generation of a synthetic seismogram from a well log and comparing the synthetic, or modeled trace, with seismic data is a common direct modeling procedure. Generating a set of pseudologs from seismic data is the process known as seismic inversion, a type of indirect modeling. Models can be developed to address problems of structure and stratigraphy prior to acquisition of seismic data and during the interpretation of the data.

Waveforms are transmitted to the surface during drilling operations and can be processed in time to yield reliable time-depth information and sometimes reflection information. Because the survey and analysis can be performed while a well is being drilled, the data can be considered in decisions during drilling operations.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seismic-while-drilling_vertical_seismic_profile

The difference in acoustic impedance between rock layers affects the reflection coefficient.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seismic_impedance
seismic acquisition,"The generation and recording of seismic data. Acquisition involves many different receiver configurations, including laying geophones or seismometers on the surface of the Earth or seafloor, towing hydrophones behind a marine seismic vessel, suspending hydrophones vertically in the sea or placing geophones in a wellbore (as in a vertical seismic profile) to record the seismic signal. A source, such as a vibrator unit, dynamite shot, or an air gun, generates acoustic or elastic vibrations that travel into the Earth, pass through strata with different seismic responses and filtering effects, and return to the surface to be recorded as seismic data. Optimal acquisition varies according to local conditions and involves employing the appropriate source (both type and intensity), optimal configuration of receivers, and orientation of receiver lines with respect to geological features. This ensures that the highest signal-to-noise ratio can be recorded, resolution is appropriate, and extraneous effects such as air waves, ground roll, multiples and diffractions can be minimized or distinguished, and removed through processing.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seismic_acquisition
smile,"A concave-upward, semicircular event in seismic data that has the appearance of a smile and can be caused by poor data migration or migration of noise.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/smile
synthetic seismogram,"The result of one of many forms of forward modeling to predict the seismic response of the Earth. A more narrow definition used by seismic interpreters is that a synthetic seismogram, commonly called a synthetic, is a direct one-dimensional model of acoustic energy traveling through the layers of the Earth. The synthetic seismogram is generated by convolving the reflectivity derived from digitized acoustic and density logs with the wavelet derived from seismic data. By comparing marker beds or other correlation points picked on well logs with major reflections on the seismic section, interpretations of the data can be improved. The quality of the match between a synthetic seismogram depends on well log quality, seismic data processing quality, and the ability to extract a representative wavelet from seismic data, among other factors. The acoustic log is generally calibrated with check-shot or vertical seismic profile (VSP) first-arrival information before combining with the density log to produce acoustic impedance.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/synthetic_seismogram

shoot a well,"To acquire a type of borehole seismic data designed to measure the seismic traveltime from the surface to a known depth. P-wave velocity of the formations encountered in a wellbore can be measured directly by lowering a geophone to each formation of interest, sending out a source of energy from the surface of the Earth, and recording the resultant signal. The data can then be correlated to surface seismic data by correcting the sonic log and generating a synthetic seismogram to confirm or modify seismic interpretations.

S-waves are generated by most land seismic sources, but not by air guns. P-waves that impinge on an interface at non-normal incidence can produce S-waves, which in that case are known as converted waves. S-waves can likewise be converted to P-waves. S-waves, or shear waves, travel more slowly than P-waves and cannot travel through fluids because fluids do not support shear. Recording of S-waves requires receivers coupled to the solid Earth.

shadow zone,"Generally, an area of the Earth from which waves do not emerge or cannot be recorded. In seismology, the term is used to more specifically describe regions of the subsurface where P-waves and S-waves are difficult to detect, such as regions of the core at certain distances from the epicenter of an earthquake, or the point on the Earth's surface directly above an earthquake. Such zones were first observed in 1914 by Beno Gutenberg (1889 to 1960), an American geologist born in Germany. Because of the molten nature of the outer core, S-waves are especially difficult to detect at 103 to 142 degrees from the epicenter of an earthquake and not observable from 142 to 180 degrees from the epicenter. Areas below salt features are also called shadow zones because the high velocity of salt bends and traps energy, so seismic data quality beneath salt is generally poor unless special seismic processing is performed.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/shadow_zone
salt proximity survey,"A type of refraction survey to help define a salt-sediment interface near a wellbore. The source is typically placed directly above the top of a salt dome and the receivers are placed at a number of locations within the borehole. This technique takes advantage of the fact that sound travels faster through the salt than the surrounding soft sediments, such as in the US Gulf Coast. This survey measures the fastest travel path, with part of its path through the salt. The resultant traveltimes are then inverted via a model to obtain a profile of the salt flanks relative to the borehole.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/salt_proximity_survey

seismology,"The study of seismic or elastic waves, such as from earthquakes, explosions or other causes. Interpretation of the structure and composition of the Earth from artificially created seismic waves is a chief concern of seismologists exploring for hydrocarbons and other resources. English physicist John Mitchell (1724 to 1793) is known as the founder of seismology in part because of his observation that one can determine an earthquake's epicenter, or point of origin in the subsurface, by measuring the arrival time of earthquake waves at different locations. The invention of the modern seismograph in 1880 promoted further studies of earthquakes.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seismology
seismic wave,"A periodic vibrational disturbance in which energy is propagated through or on the surface of a medium without translation of the material. Waves can be differentiated by their frequency, amplitude, wavelength and speed of propagation.

seismograph,"A device or system that records the ground oscillations that make up exploration seismic data or earthquakes, sometimes used incorrectly as a synonym for geophone. A seismograph can include amplifiers, receivers and a recording device (such as a computer disk or magnetic tape) to record seismograms. A crude seismograph was built in 1855 by Italian physicist Luigi Palmieri (1807 to 1896). The modern seismograph, which used a pendulum, was invented in 1880 by James Ewing, Thomas Gray and Sir John Milne.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seismograph

seismic velocity,"The rate at which a seismic wave travels through a medium, that is, distance divided by traveltime. Seismic velocity can be determined from vertical seismic profiles or from velocity analysis of seismic data. It can vary vertically, laterally and azimuthally in anisotropic media and tends to increase with depth in the Earth because compaction reduces porosity. Velocity also varies as a function of how it is derived from the data. For example, the stacking velocity derived from normal moveout measurements of common depth point gathers differs from the average velocity measured vertically from a check-shot or vertical seismic profile (VSP). Velocity would be the same only in a constant-velocity (homogeneous) medium.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seismic_velocity

A seismic trace represents the response of the elastic wavefield to velocity and density contrasts across interfaces of layers of rock or sediments as energy travels from a source through the subsurface to a receiver or receiver array.,Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seismic_trace
seismic stratigraphy,"Another term for sequence stratigraphy, a field of study in which basin-filling sedimentary deposits, called sequences, are interpreted in a framework of eustasy, sedimentation and subsidence through time in order to correlate strata and predict the stratigraphy of relatively unknown areas. Sequences tend to show cyclicity of changes in relative sea level and widespread unconformities, processes of sedimentation and sources of sediments, climate and tectonic activity over time. Sequence stratigraphic study promotes thorough understanding of the evolution of basins, but also allows for interpretations of potential source rocks and reservoir rocks in both frontier areas (having seismic data but little well data) and in more mature hydrocarbon provinces. Prediction of reservoir continuity is currently a key question in mature hydrocarbon provinces where sequence stratigraphy is being applied. The field originated during the 1960s with the study of the stratigraphy of the continental USA, where numerous unconformities could be correlated widely, and led to the proposal that major unconformities might mark synchronous global-scale events. Through sequence stratigraphy, widely-separated sediments that occur between correlatable unconformities could be compared with each other. Studies of outcrops and seismic lines bore out these concepts, which initially were called ""Seismic Stratigraphy"" and first published widely in 1977. Further study of seismic lines led to the interpretation of the geometry or architecture of seismic events as representing particular styles of sedimentation and depositional environments, and the integration of such interpretations with well log and core data. Because of the simultaneous, competitive nature of the research, numerous oil companies and academic groups use the terminology of sequence stratigraphy differently, and new terms are added continually.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/seismic_stratigraphy

moving-source method,An acquisition technique most commonly used in electromagnetic methods whereby the energy source or transmitter and detectors or receivers are kept in the same relative position and moved together to different spots to compile a profile or map.,Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/moving-source_method
modulus of elasticity,"Any one of a set of constants, also known as elastic moduli, that defines the properties of material that undergoes stress, deforms, and then recovers and returns to its original shape after the stress ceases. The elastic constants include the bulk modulus, Lame constant, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus, and Young's modulus. Elastic constants are important in seismology because the velocity of waves depends on the elastic constants and density of the rock.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/modulus_of_elasticity
modulus of rigidity,"Another term for shear modulus, an elastic constant for the ratio of shear stress to shear strain. The shear modulus is one of the Lamé constants. It can be expressed mathematically as follows:",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/modulus_of_rigidity
modulus of compression,"Another term for bulk modulus, the ratio of stress to strain, abbreviated as k. The bulk modulus is an elastic constant equal to the applied stress divided by the ratio of the change in volume to the original volume of a body.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/modulus_of_compression
multiple reflection,"Multiply reflected seismic energy, or any event in seismic data that has incurred more than one reflection in its travel path. Depending on their time delay from the primary events with which they are associated, multiples are characterized as short-path or peg-leg, implying that they interfere with the primary reflection, or long-path, where they appear as separate events. Multiples from the water bottom (the interface of the base of water and the rock or sediment beneath it) and the air-water interface are common in marine seismic data, and are suppressed by seismic processing.",Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiple_reflection
elastic impedance,The product of the density of a medium and its shear wave velocity.,Noun,Geophysics,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/e/elastic_impedance
elastic constants,"A set of constants, also known as elastic moduli, that defines the properties of material that undergoes stress, deforms, and then recovers and returns to its original shape after the stress ceases.
