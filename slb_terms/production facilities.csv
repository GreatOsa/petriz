hydrogen sulfide,"[H2S] An extraordinarily poisonous gas with a molecular formula of H2S. At low concentrations, H2S has the odor of rotten eggs, but at higher, lethal concentrations, it is odorless. H2S is hazardous to workers and a few seconds of exposure at relatively low concentrations can be lethal, but exposure to lower concentrations can also be harmful. The effect of H2S depends on duration, frequency and intensity of exposure as well as the susceptibility of the individual. Hydrogen sulfide is a serious and potentially lethal hazard, so awareness, detection and monitoring of H2S is essential. Since hydrogen sulfide gas is present in some subsurface formations, drilling and other operational crews must be prepared to use detection equipment, personal protective equipment, proper training and contingency procedures in H2S-prone areas. Hydrogen sulfide is produced during the decomposition of organic matter and occurs with hydrocarbons in some areas. It enters drilling mud from subsurface formations and can also be generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria in stored muds. H2S can cause sulfide-stress-corrosion cracking of metals. Because it is corrosive, H2S production may require costly special production equipment such as stainless steel tubing. Sulfides can be precipitated harmlessly from water muds or oil muds by treatments with the proper sulfide scavenger. H2S is a weak acid, donating two hydrogen ions in neutralization reactions, forming HS- and S-2 ions. In water or water-base muds, the three sulfide species, H2S and HS- and S-2 ions, are in dynamic equilibrium with water and H+ and OH- ions. The percent distribution among the three sulfide species depends on pH. H2S is dominant at low pH, the HS- ion is dominant at mid-range pH and S2 ions dominate at high pH. In this equilibrium situation, sulfide ions revert to H2S if pH falls. Sulfides in water mud and oil mud can be quantitatively measured with the Garrett Gas Train according to procedures set by API.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/h/hydrogen_sulfide

heater,"Equipment that transfers heat to the produced gas stream. Heaters are especially used when producing natural gas or condensate to avoid the formation of ice and gas hydrates. These solids can plug the wellhead, chokes and flowlines. The production of natural gas is usually accompanied by water vapor. As this mixture is produced, it cools down on its way to the surface and also when the mixture passes through a surface production choke.

If liquid water or oil enters the dehydrator, the device cannot work properly.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/dehydrator
dehydrate,"To remove water from a substance. The substance may be crude oil, natural gas, or natural gas liquids (NGL). Fluid dehydration is needed to prevent corrosion and free-water accumulation in the low points of a pipeline. In the case of gas, it is especially important to avoid hydrate formation and also to meet pipeline requirements. Typical maximum allowable water vapor content is 7 pounds of water per million standard cubic feet. In colder climates, this threshold value could be 3 to 5 pounds per million standard cubic feet.

Desiccants also can be solid, such as silica gel or calcium chloride [CaCl2]. The most common gas-dehydration system (glycol dehydrator) uses liquid desiccants such as diethylene, triethylene and tetraethylene, which are substances that can be regenerated. Regeneration means that the water absorbed by these substances can be separated from them. Some liquid desiccants such as methanol or ethylene cannot be regenerated. Solid desiccants are also used for gas dehydration. They are placed as beds through which wet gas is passed. The main limitation of the use of solid desiccants is that they absorb only limited quantities of water. When the desiccant saturation point is reached, the solid desiccant must be replaced.

stage separation,"An operation in which the well stream is passed through two or more separators that are arranged in series. The first separator is called first-stage separator, the second separator is called second-stage separator and additional separators are named according to their position in the series. The operating pressures are sequentially reduced, so the highest pressure is found at the first separator and the lowest pressure at the final separator. The objective of stage separation is to maximize the hydrocarbon liquid recovery and to provide maximum stabilization to the resultant phases (liquid and gas) leaving the final separator. Stabilization means that considerable amounts of gas or liquid will not evolve from the final liquid and gas phases, respectively, in places such as stock tanks or gas pipelines. Additionally, stage separation reduces the horsepower required by a compressor, since the gas is fed at higher pressures.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/s/stage_separation
vapor recovery unit,"A system composed of a scrubber, a compressor and a switch. Its main purpose is to recover vapors formed inside completely sealed crude oil or condensate tanks. The switch detects pressure variations inside the tanks and turns the compressor on and off. The vapors are sucked through a scrubber, where the liquid trapped is returned to the liquid pipeline system or to the tanks, and the vapor recovered is pumped into gas lines.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/v/vapor_recovery_unit
Trans-Alaska Pipeline System,"An 800-mi [1,287-km], 48-in [122-cm] pipeline that transports more than 1 million barrels of oil from Deadhorse (near Prudhoe Bay) to Valdez, Alaska, USA. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System was completed in 1977, and it is often abbreviated as TAPS.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/trans-alaska_pipeline_system
TAPS,Abbreviation for Trans-Alaska Pipeline System,Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/taps
test separator,"A vessel used to separate and meter relatively small quantities of oil and gas. Test separators can be two-phase or three-phase, or horizontal, vertical or spherical. They can also be permanent or portable. Test separators sometimes are equipped with different meters to determine oil, water and gas rates, which are important to diagnose well problems, evaluate production performance of individual wells and manage reserves properly. Test separators can also be called well testers or a well checkers.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/test_separator
two-phase separator,"A vessel that separates the well fluids into gas and total liquid. A two-phase separator can be horizontal, vertical or spherical. The liquid (oil, emulsion) leaves the vessel at the bottom through a level-control or dump valve. The gas leaves the vessel at the top, passing through a mist extractor to remove the small liquid droplets in the gas.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/two-phase_separator
treater,"A vessel used to treat oil-water emulsions so the oil can be accepted by the pipeline or transport. A treater can use several mechanisms. These include heat, gravity segregation, chemical additives and electric current to break emulsions. There are vertical and horizontal treaters. The main difference between them is the residence time, which is shorter in the vertical configuration compared with the horizontal one. A treater can be called a heater treater or an emulsion treater.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/treater
thief,A device that can be lowered into a tank to obtain samples (liquid or sediments) at different depths. The samples are analyzed to determine the gravity and BS&W content of the fluid into the tank.,Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thief
tight emulsion,An emulsion with small and closely distributed droplets. A tight emulsion can be difficult to break.,Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tight_emulsion
thief hatch,An opening in the top of the stock tank. The thief hatch allows tank access for a thief or other level measuring devices.,Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/thief_hatch
three-phase separator,"A vessel that separates the well fluids into gas and two types of liquids: oil and water. A three-phase separator can be horizontal, vertical or spherical. This type of separator is commonly called a free-water knockout because its main use is to remove any free water that can cause problems such as corrosion and formation of hydrates or tight emulsions, which are difficult to break. A free-water knockout is commonly called a three-phase separator because it can separate gas, oil and free water. The liquids that are discharged from the free-water knockout are further treated in vessels called treaters. Free-water knockout is abbreviated as FWKO.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/three-phase_separator
tankage,The capacity of all the tanks in a field.,Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tankage
tanker,"A ship designed to transport crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), synthetic natural gas (SNG) or refined products. Tankers with 100,000 deadweight tons of capacity or more are called supertankers (very large crude carriers or ultralarge crude carriers). A tanker is also called a tank ship.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/t/tanker

multiphase pump,"A pump that can handle the complete production from a well (oil, natural gas, water and sand, for example) without needing to separate or process the production stream near or at the wellhead. This reduces the cost associated with the surface facilities. Using multiphase pumps allows development of remote locations or previously uneconomical fields. Additionally, since the surface equipment, including separators, heater-treaters, dehydrators and pipes, is reduced, the impact on the environment is also reduced. Multiphase pumps can handle high gas volumes as well as the slugging and different flow regimes associated with multiphase production. Multiphase pumps include twin-screw pumps, piston pumps and helicoaxial pumps.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/multiphase_pump
mist extractor,"A device used to collect small liquid droplets (moisture or hydrocarbons) from the gas stream before it leaves the separator. The two most common types of mist extractors are wire-mesh pads and vanes. Once the small droplets of liquid are collected, they are removed along with the other liquids from the separator.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mist_extractor
mist,"Small liquid droplets (moisture or liquid hydrocarbons) in a gas stream. In separators, mist extractors are used to collect mist.",Noun,Production Facilities,https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/m/mist
